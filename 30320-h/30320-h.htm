<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p>In his young manhood the writer of
these sketches came up into this realm of
widest vision, clearest skies, sweetest waters,
and happiest people to engraft the green
twig of his life upon the activities of the
mountaineers of the thrilling West.</p>
<p>At that time the vast plains and the barren
valleys were silvered over with the
ubiquitous sage through which crept lazily
and aimlessly the many unharnessed arroyo-making
streams waiting only the appearance
of their master, man. Under his scientific,
skilled, and economic guidance these
wild waters, lassoed, tamed, and set to
work, taking the place of clouds where there
are none, were soon to cause the gray
garden of nature to become goldened by the
well-nigh illimitable acres of grain and other
home-making products.</p>
<p>The West has an abundant variety of
life of a sort most intensely human. Life,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
always so earnest in Anglo-Saxon lands,
seems to have accentuated individuality
here in a wondrous and contagious degree.</p>
<p>These few stories, culled from the r&eacute;pertoire
of an active life of more than thirty
years, are samples of personal experiences,
and are taken almost at random from
mining camp, frontier town and settlement,
public and private life.</p>
<p>As a minister the writer has had wide
and varied opportunities in all the Northwest,
but more especially in Utah, Oregon,
and Idaho. Many a man much more modest
has far excelled him in life experiences,
but some of them have never told.</p>
<p>This little handful of goldenrod is affectionately
dedicated to them of the Trails.</p>

<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:2em;font-size:1.4em;'>THE WESTERN TRAIL</p>
<p>&ldquo;An overland highway to the Western
sea&rdquo; was the thought variously expressed
by many men in both public and private
life among the French, English, and Americans
from very early times. In 1659
Pierre Radisson and a companion, by way
of the Great Lakes, Fox, and &ldquo;Ouisconsing&rdquo;
Rivers, discovered the &ldquo;east fork&rdquo; of the
&ldquo;Great River&rdquo; and crossed to the &ldquo;west
fork,&rdquo; up which they went into what is
now the Dakotas, only to find it going
still &ldquo;interminably westward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1766 Carver, an Englishman, went by
the same route up the &ldquo;east fork&rdquo; to Saint
Anthony Falls; thence he traveled to Canada,
to learn from the Assiniboin Indians
the existence of the &ldquo;Shining Mountains&rdquo;
and that beyond them was the &ldquo;Oregan,&rdquo;
which went to the salt sea.</p>
<p>As early as 1783 Thomas Jefferson wrote
to George Rogers Clark to tell him he understood
the English had subscribed a very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
large sum of money for exploration of the
country west of the Mississippi, and as far
as California. He even expressed himself as
being desirous of forming a party of Americans
to make the trip.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, under the direction of
<i>President</i> Thomas Jefferson, General Clark
was made a member of the Lewis and
Clark Expedition, which went up the &ldquo;great
river&rdquo; and ultimately crossed through Montana
and Idaho to the Columbia (Oregan?)
and the &ldquo;salt sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zebulon Pike was turned back by the
imperious Rocky Mountains in 1806. A
few years later Captain Bonneville braved
the plains, the plateaus, the mountain
passes, and the deserts, and saw the Columbia.
Then continuous migrations finally
fixed the overland highway known from
ocean to ocean as the Oregon Trail.</p>
<p>The Mormons followed this national road
when they trekked to the valley of Salt
Lake in 1847&ndash;&ndash;a dolorous path to many.</p>
<p>Because the Oregon Trail was nature&rsquo;s
way, man and commerce made it their
way. Road sites are not like city sites&ndash;&ndash;made
to order; they are discovered. For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
that reason the pioneer railway transcontinental
also followed this trail. The Union
Pacific marks with iron what so many of
the emigrants marked with their tears and
their graves. From the mouth of the
Platte to the heart of the Rocky Mountains
and beyond is a continuous cemetery
of nameless tombs.</p>
<p>The next few pages will give some
sketches of fact depicting scenes of sunlight
and shadow that fell on this highway
in days not so very long agone.</p>

<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:2em;font-size:1.4em;'>THE LONG TRAIL</p>
<p>The Old Overland Trail from the Missouri
River to the Willamette is a distance
of nearly two thousand miles. Before Jason
Lee and Marcus Whitman sanctioned its
use for the migrating myriads of Americans
seeking the shores of the sunset sea, trappers
and adventurers, good and bad, had
mapped out a general route over the wind-whipped
passes, where the storm stands
sentinel and guards the granite ways among
the rough Rocky Mountains. They had
followed the falls-filled Snake and the
calmer Columbia, which plow for a thousand
miles or more among basaltic bastions
buttressing the mountain sides, or through
the lava lands where cavernous chasms
yawn and abysmal depths echo back the
sullen roar of the raging rapids.</p>
<p>In the early forties of the nineteenth
century restless spirits from Missouri and
eastward began to filter through the fingertips
of the beckoning mountains of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
West and locate in the land where storms
seldom come and where the extremes of
heat and cold are unknown&ndash;&ndash;Willamette
Valley, Oregon.</p>
<p>In these early days, a farmer, whom we
shall name Johnson, with wife and son,
hoping to better conditions and prolong life,
thus sought the goal toward the setting sun.
Starting when the sturdy spring was enlivening
all nature, they left the malarial
marshes of the Mississippi Valley, where
quinine and whisky for &ldquo;fevernagur&rdquo; were
to be had at every crossroads store, and in a
couple of weeks found themselves west of
the muddy Missouri, where the herds of
humped bison grazed as yet unafraid among
the rolling, well-wooded hills of eastern
Kansas.</p>
<p>Barring a few common hindrances, they
went well and reached the higher and
hotter plains in midsummer; they were out
of the sight of hills and trees&ndash;&ndash;just one
weary, eternal, unchangeable vista day
after day. Mrs. Johnson had not been
well, and after a few weeks that promised
more for the future than they fulfilled, she
began gradually to lose strength.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>But she was made of the uncomplaining
material pioneers are wrought of, the ones
who so lived, loved, and labored that the
hard-earned sweets of civilization grew to
highest perfection about their graves, and
proved the most enduring monument to
their memory. She never murmured other
than to ask occasionally: &ldquo;Father, how
much farther? Isn&rsquo;t it a wonderfully long
way to Oregon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just over that next range of hills, I
think, from what the trappers told me,&rdquo;
was the reply, after they had come to the
toes of the foothills that terminate the
long-lying limbs of the giant Rockies. But
he did not know the stealth of the mountains
nor the fantastic pranks the ca&ntilde;ony
ranges can play upon the stranger. A
snowy-haired peak, brother to Father
Time, wearing a fringe of evergreens for
his neckruff, would play hide-and-seek
with them for days, dodging behind
this eminence and hiding away back of
that hill, only to reappear apparently as
far off as ever, and sometimes in a different
direction from where he last seemed
to be.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>After a few more days: &ldquo;Father, how
many more miles do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, not many now, I am sure!&rdquo; cheerily
and optimistically would come the answer.</p>
<p>As they climbed, and climbed, and
climbed, the ripening service-berry, blackened
by weeks of attention by the unclouded
sun, and the pine-hen and the
speckled beauties from the noisy trout-streams,
added to their comforts, and for a
little while appeared to enliven the tired
and fading woman. A frosty night or two,
a peak newly whitened with early snow,
put an invigorating thrill and pulse into
the blood of the man and the boy, but she
crept just a little nearer to the camp fire
of evenings and found herself more and
more languid in responding to the call of
the day that returned all too soon for her.
At last, rolling out on the Wahsatch side
of the continental backbone, they encountered
very warm but shortening days, while
the nights grew chillier. Having passed to
the north of Salt Lake by the trail so well
and faithfully marked by Mr. Ezra Meeker in
recent years, they began to realize that they
were with the waters that flow to the west.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>One evening, after the tin plates, iron
forks and knives, and the pewter spoons
had been washed and returned to their box,
and as they were getting ready for their
nightly rest, Mrs. Johnson said, wearily:
&ldquo;Father, it just seems to me I would be
glad if I never would waken again. It
seems I would enjoy never again hearing the
everlasting squeech, squeech of the wheels
in the sand, and see the sun go down day
after day so red and so far away over those
new mountains. O, I am so tired!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, mother, we are not far
from our new home now;&rdquo; and moving
over to her side as she sat leaning against
the wagon-tongue, the man slipped his own
tired arm about her shoulders and let her
rest against him, for he was indeed weary,
and the trail <i>was</i> wonderfully long.</p>
<p>The following morning he purposely lay
still just a little longer than was his custom,
although he was most prudently desirous of
making as much speed as he could while
the weather continued so good; he knew
the rains might soon set in and make
travel over unmade roads much worse than
it already was.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>When he arose he noiselessly crept
away from her side and quietly called the
boy to go and bring up the horses and the
cow, cautioning him to take off the horse-bell
and carry it so as not to arouse the
mother when he came to camp. Quietly
as possible he made the fire and prepared
their breakfast of fare that was daily becoming
scantier. Then, when all was ready,
he tiptoed through the sand to where she
lay under the spreading arms of a little
desert juniper, such as are occasionally
found in the deserts, and where she had
said the night before she wished she could
sleep forever. She looked so calm and
restful he hesitated to wake her; it seemed
like robbery to take from her one moment
of the longed-for and hard-earned rest.
Yet it was time they were on their road, and
the day was fine; so after a few minutes he
called, gently, &ldquo;Mother, you&rsquo;re getting a
nice rest, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not stir. He then stooped to
kiss the languid lips&ndash;&ndash;they were cold. She
was dead. They had been seeking a home
by the shores of the sunset sea; she had
found the sunrise land.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>It is a sad, solemn, and sacred thing to be
with our dead, but to be alone, hundreds of
miles from the face of any friend, in such
an hour, is an experience few ever have to
meet. Pioneer-like, the father scans the
horizon, locating all the prominent features
of the landscape. He makes a rude map,
not forgetting the juniper. As best he can
he prepares the body for the burying. And
such a burying! No lumber with which to
make even a rough box; nothing but their
daily clothing and nightly bedding was to
be had. The unlined grave was more than
usually forbidding. The desert demon had
trailed that brave body and was now swallowing
it up. They made the grave by the
juniper where she last slept, and, sorrowing,
the father and the son went on, firm in the
resolve that the loved one should not
always lie in a desert grave.</p>
<p>Forty years later a man past middle-age,
riding a horse and leading another, to
whose packsaddle was fastened a box, went
slowly along that old trail in Southern
Idaho, now almost obliterated by many-footed
Progress. He was scanning the hills
and consulting a piece of age-yellowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
paper, broken at all its ancient creases. It
was the son obeying the dying request of
the old father&ndash;&ndash;going to find, if possible,
the spot where the tired mother went to
sleep so long ago, and bring all that remained
to rest by his side.</p>
<p>It was no easy task. Fertile fields, whose
irrigated areas now presented billowy
breasts of ripening grain; mighty ditches
like younger and better-behaved rivers; a
railway following the general direction of
the old trail; ranch-houses and fat haystacks
indenting the sky-line once so bare
of all except clumps of sagebrush&ndash;&ndash;these
all conspired to make the task next to
impossible.</p>
<p>Man may scratch the hillsides, but cannot
mar the majesty of the mountains;
they were unchanged. The map he carried
was the one his father made on the
spot more than a generation before. It
had been well made and the specifications
were minute. After a long while, carefully
measuring and comparing, he found the
spot to him so sacred. The juniper tree,
so rare in that section, had not been disturbed
by the new owner of the land, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
as the precious burden, secured at last, was
borne away, it still stood on guard&ndash;&ndash;as if
lonely now. Like father, like son. Both
were faithfully bound by the strongest tie
in the universe&ndash;&ndash;love!</p>

<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:2em;font-size:1.4em;'>THE DESERT</p>
<p>Much of the Old Overland Trail lay
across the &ldquo;Great American Desert,&rdquo; as it
was named in the earlier geographies. Irrigation
and progressive energy have made
these wastes in many instances literally to
&ldquo;blossom as the rose&rdquo;; but until that was
done these stretches were weary enough.</p>
<p>He who knows only the desert of the
geography naturally conceives it an absolutely
forsaken and empty region where
nothing but dust-storms are born unattended
and die &ldquo;without benefit of the
clergy.&rdquo; But the desert has character and
is as variable as many another creature.</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:2em;'>THE SAND STORM</p>
<p>An experience in an actual sand storm is
food upon which the reminiscent may ruminate
many a day, being much more pleasant
in memory than in the making. First come
the scurrying outriders, lithe and limber
whisking gusts, dancing and whirling like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
Moslem dervishes, coyly brushing the traveler
or boldly flinging fierce fistfuls of dirt
into his eyes; then off with a swish of invisible
skirts&ndash;&ndash;vanishing possibly in the
same direction whence they came. They
go leaving him wiping his astonished eyes
disgustedly, for the act was so sudden and
tragic as to excite tears. Before he is aware
of it other and stronger gusts duplicate the
dastardly deed of the first wingless wizard
of the plains, and the hapless voyager is
left gasping. Almost immediately there are
to be seen the regular &ldquo;desert devils,&rdquo; as
they are called, bringing a dozen or more
whirling columns of yellow silt rapidly
through the air, each pirouetting on one
foot, assuming meanwhile all sorts of fantastic
shapes.</p>
<p>Now for the fierce onset. Like blasts of
a blizzard, the shrapnel of the desert is
hurled into eyes, face, ears, and nostrils;
little rivers pour down the back and fill
every discoverable wrinkle and cranny of
the clothing with their gritty load.</p>
<p>If in summer, buttoning the clothing is
suffocation, and the perspiration soon makes
one a mass of grime; if in winter, it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
not so unbearable, for a comfortable fencing
can be made against the sand and the
cold.</p>
<p>The whole landscape is obliterated by and
by, and the trails are so often drift-filled
that unless one is himself accustomed to
such methods of travel or has an experienced
plainsman as his driver and guide, there is
danger of becoming lost, or so out of the
way that night may overtake him and
compel a waterless camp for himself and
team.</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:2em;'>TWILIGHT AND DAWN</p>
<p>But to see the morning slip off its night
clothes and step out into daylight, or
watch day don her night-wraps and snuggle
down into twilight on the quiet sand-ocean!
In summer it is a scene of splendor, often
coming after a day or an evening of sandy
wrath.</p>
<p>At early dawn, lining the eastern horizon,
are the soft pencils of bashful day over-topping
the jagged sawteeth of the yet
sleeping mountains, fifty or more miles
away. A faint hinting of the lightening of
the sky only deepens the blackness of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
snow-streaked peaks. The cowardly coyote&rsquo;s
yelp comes more and more faintly,
the burrowing owl&rsquo;s &ldquo;to-whit, to-whoo&rdquo;
falls dying on the moveless air, and the
white sparrow of the sagebrush starts up
as if to catch the early worm he is almost
sure not to find. The loping jack rabbit
slips softly to his greasewood shelter and
the prairie dog bounces barking from his
snake-infested haunt, noisily preparing for
his day&rsquo;s digging and foraging.</p>
<p>The stubborn mountains begin to let the
sun&rsquo;s forerunning rays glide between them;
the sky, now old gold, is fast transforming
into kaleidoscopic crimsons and other reds,
while the swift arms of the day-painter are
reaching from between the peaks of the
precipitous crags and dyeing the scales of
the mackerel sky with hues and tints the
rainbow would covet.</p>
<p>In the opposite direction a morning
mirage inverts an image of a stretch of
trees along the far-away river and blends
them top to top till they seem greenish-black
columns supporting the dun clouds
of the west, while the belated moon peers
through the half-unreal corridors.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:2em;'>SUNSET</p>
<p>The sunset is far more gorgeous; it often
reaches grandeur. Let it be a winter evening.
A suggestion of storm has been playing
threats. The western hills have reached
up their time-toughened arms and carried
the burnt-out lantern of day to bed, tucking
him away in gold-lace tapestry and
rose-tinted down. Then the blue, black,
and brown clouds change quickly to purple,
pink, and red by turns, and the opaline sky
itself forms a background for the dissolving
community of interlacing filaments
of priceless filigree, till in time too full of
interest to compute by measure, the whole
heavens are aflame with a riotous orgy of
color, a prodigality of shifting scene, making
one think of the descriptions essayed by
the writer of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>We think of Moses who wished to see
God &ldquo;face to face,&rdquo; but was told he would
be permitted to behold only the &ldquo;dying
away of his glory.&rdquo; No wonder the man
who was forty years in the wilderness before
that grand exode, and forty more
through the unsurveyed deserts, was enabled
to write the majestic prose-poems
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
that have lived unaltered through all these
thousands of critical years! He was in
the region where inspiration is dispensed
with hands of infinite wealth. God is the
dispenser.

<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:2em;font-size:1.4em;'>SAGEBRUSH</p>
<p>Frequently within these pages mention
has been made of the commonest of all our
native plants on the Trail&ndash;&ndash;sagebrush. Botanically,
it is, <i>Artemisia tridentata</i>. The
new Standard Dictionary defines sagebrush
as &ldquo;any one of the various shrubby species
of Artemisia, of the aster family, growing
on the elevated plains of the Western
United States, especially <i>Artemisia tridentata</i>,
very abundant from Montana to Colorado
and westward.&rdquo; The leaf ends in
three points; hence the adjective tridentata&ndash;&ndash;the
three-toothed artemisia.</p>
<p>There are several varieties of sagebrush,
and a person not well acquainted with the
desert might easily mistake one for the
other. There are the white sage, a good
forage plant for sheep, and the yellow sage,
which, when properly taken, can be made
useful for cattle. Then there is the common
variety, the sort named above. This
is not to be mistaken for the prickly greasewood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
which infests the more alkaline regions;
nor the rabbit-brush with its blossom
so like the goldenrod, but with a very disagreeable
odor. No man who knows will
ever buy land where the greasewood grows
thickly; it is unproductive because of the
large percentage of alkali. But the ancient-looking
sage is a pretty sure indication of
fertility of soil. Mother Nature is sometimes
hard pushed to find dresses for all
her poorer areas; of course the better portions
of the land east or west, north or
south, care for their clothes better than do
these arid stretches and the clothing is a
richer vegetation.</p>
<p>This ever-gray, little hunger-pinched
pygmy among trees looks about as much
like an oak as does a diminutive monkey
like a grown man.</p>
<p>A peculiarity of this individual in treedom
is that it keeps its ash-colored leaf
until it has a new set to put on in the
spring, so that all winter long it presents
the same color as it does in the summertime.
Its bark is loose and shaggy, being
shed rapidly, and gives one the thought of
the old grape vine; hanging in bunches, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
bole has always a ragged appearance. It
is truly the dry-land plant, always found
where the alkali or water is not too abundant;
but in favored spots where there is
only a little dampness and not too much
fierceness of the summer heat it grows
eight or ten feet high, making a body
large enough for fence posts. This is extraordinary,
for usually these Liliputian
forests do not attain a height of more than
four feet, and often much less. So diminutive
are these solemn woods that the
ordinary gang-plow can walk right through
them, turning the shrubbery under like tall
grass, although every tree is perfect, just
like the dwarf creations produced by the
resourceful Japanese.</p>
<p>The seed of this tiny tree grows on stiff,
upright filaments like the broom-corn
straws. These stems are very bitter and
are often used by the range-riders on long
rides or roundups to excite the flow of
saliva when thirst overtakes them too far
from water. Because of its bitterness it is
often called wormwood.</p>
<p>Not many uses have been found for the
wood of these primeval forests. In many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
sections the people have nothing but sagebrush
for firewood. The whole tree is
used, special stoves, or heaters, being made
to accommodate the whole plant. It is
gathered in the following manner: Two
immense T-rails of railroad iron are laid
side by side, one inverted, and securely
fastened together; to the ends of these are
hitched two teams of horses or mules, which
pulling parallel to each other, are driven
into the standing fairy forests and the
swaths of fallen timber show the track of
this unnatural storm. Its roots have such
slight hold on the soil that it easily falls.
Wagons and pitchforks follow, and the
whole of the felling is hauled untrimmed to
the home for hand-axing if too large; and
it is all burned, top and root. There is so
much vegetable oil in this queer plant that
it makes a fine and very quick fire, green or
dry.</p>
<p>After a summer rain there is no aromatic
perfume surpassing that of the odor of
sagebrush filling the newly washed air.
The mountaineer who has had to make a
trip East gladly opens his window, as his
train pushes back into the habitat of these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
aromatic shrubs, to get an early whiff of
the health-laden, sage-sweetened atmosphere
of the beloved Westland and homeland.</p>

<a name='A_RAILROAD_SAINT_IN_IDAHO' id='A_RAILROAD_SAINT_IN_IDAHO'></a>
<h2>A RAILROAD SAINT IN IDAHO</h2>
</div>
<p>The &ldquo;railroad saint&rdquo; was a locomotive
engineer. His life was ever an open book,
yet while careful and almost severe in his
personal religious habits, he did not criticize
the manners of his associates. He
simply let his well kept searchlight shine.</p>
<p>Though born in Ohio, his boy life was
spent mainly in Nebraska, when it was
just emerging from the ragged swaddlings
of rough frontierdom; and during his young
manhood he lived in Wyoming, at the time
when men &ldquo;carried the law in their hip-pockets,&rdquo;
as he graphically expressed it.</p>
<p>Early becoming an employee of the
Union Pacific, he was a permanent portion
of its westward intermountain extension,
and he did his life&rsquo;s work among the scenic
cliffs and clefts of the picturesque crags
and corrugated ca&ntilde;ons of the wrinkled
ridges in the Rocky and the Wahsatch
ranges. Opportunities for literary education
were very limited to one so engaged,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
and little more than what was absolutely
necessary to the railmen did he receive.
But he was not ignorant by any means.
In later years he read extendedly and with
careful discrimination. He had a poet&rsquo;s
soul, but was not visionary.</p>
<p>His mother had been a careful and sensible
Christian. The indelible impress she
left upon him was like to that given by
Jochebed to her son Moses. He never
wholly escaped from her hallowed influence,
although he descended into vicious living
and became a notorious and blatant blasphemer,
sceptic, and drunkard.</p>
<p>Once when attending a national convention
of railway engineers in an Eastern city
he noticed a little flower boy vainly attempting
to dispose of his roses. Our
engineer (who always had a feeling for the
&ldquo;other fellow&rdquo;) paid the lad for all he had
left and directed him to carry them to the
hotel where the delegates were stopping,
and give them to the ladies in the parlor.
This act was repeated on successive days.
It attracted attention finally, and one of
the delegates asked him if he were a Christian.
Characteristically he blurted out:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
&ldquo;Do you see anything about me that indicates
it? If so, I will take it off at once.
Why do you ask such a question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the questioner, &ldquo;your
kindness to that pale-faced little flower
boy makes people think you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all queer about that,&rdquo; was
the quick reply. &ldquo;Common humanity
should dictate such deeds. If I myself
wanted a favor, I&rsquo;d not go to any Christian
for it; I&rsquo;d rather tackle a bartender or a
gambler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dr. T&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, of the Methodist
Church, has heard of you,&rdquo; remarked his
questioner, &ldquo;and he says he would like to
meet you for an hour or so before you
leave the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve no desire to meet any preacher,
though if it will afford the gentleman any
pleasure, I will gladly do it for that reason
and no other. What do you suppose he
wants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intermediary arranged a time of
meeting, and after introducing the men,
left the &ldquo;eagle eye&rdquo; in the pleasant study
of the minister, a pastor of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South. After a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
minutes of easy conversation, the minister
abruptly cut all Gordian knots and said:
&ldquo;Mr.&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, are you a Christian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not so you can notice it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gives to every one who embraces true
religion a better, broader, worthier view
and conception of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherein, mister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It puts purpose into his life and interprets
the end to which he is tending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came up from the keen intellect-quiver
of our Rocky Mountain engineman
all the stock phrases, replies, and arguments
of Voltaire, Rousseau, Ingersoll, and
others whose writings he knew perfectly.</p>
<p>With Christian and cultivated patience
the minister listened and then said with
captivating and sympathetic tenderness:
&ldquo;But, my dear sir, that is all speculation
on the part of those scholarly and eloquent
men whom you quote so accurately. They
know no better. The religion of Jesus is
not speculation; it is practical knowledge.
Would not you, sir, like to know personally
as to its truth?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but how can I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His foot had been taken in the snare of
the wise trapper.</p>
<p>Said the preacher: &ldquo;You can; and this
is the way. As you leave this city for
your return to the West, get a cheap New
Testament; indeed, here is a copy; please
accept it. Tear it in two in the middle,
retaining only the four Gospels&ndash;&ndash;Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John. Read them; you
will by yourself and by this means find
the way to perfect knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He of the throttle, hungry for the deepest
knowledge, did as directed and advised.</p>
<p>Back to his cab and engine he went,
under the deepest conviction. Yet he declared
that he needed no extraneous assistance
to be as good as any Christian;
Jesus he considered a superfluity, and said
so. The negative influences of the atheistic
authors yet warped him. He said: &ldquo;I dare
any of you to watch me. I can and will be
as upright as any Christian on earth.&rdquo;
But after a short time of exemplary conduct,
he would wake up some morning only
to discover to his hearty disgust that he
had been on an extended period of dissipation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Later he would attempt another
straightening-up and try to &ldquo;be good&rdquo;
without the necessary becoming so, only to
fall again and harder than before.</p>
<p>Once, after such humiliating debauch, he
entered a saloon which contained the only
barber shop in the village, the railway
division point where he had his &ldquo;layovers&rdquo;
for regular rest. He sat down for
his daily shave. It was the morning after
pay-day among the employees, and, as he
stated it to the writer, &ldquo;everybody, even
the barber, had been drunk.&rdquo; Cigar stumps,
empty bottles, cards, and other plentiful
signs of the previous night&rsquo;s carousals covered
the floor with bacchanalian litter.
Lying there, eyes shut, an Armageddon was
taking place on the stage of his perturbed
soul. His story is this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While lying there that morning a voice
said to me, &lsquo;You are not a square-dealer.&rsquo;
I opened my eyes on the barber, only to see
a bloated face with impassive and mute
lips; he had said nothing, I could easily see.
I closed my eyes again, only to hear, &lsquo;You
do not treat me as you would a gentleman.&rsquo;
I now knew that the voice was that of an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
unseen person, and I replied mentally but
really. &lsquo;Who are you, and what do you
want?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am Jesus, whom you deny without
having known, and condemn without
having attempted to prove. You have
been saying all the while you can succeed
without my assistance, and you know you
have failed every time. All I want is a
chance in your life that I may prove myself
to you.&rsquo; Then I replied, &lsquo;If this is what
you want, just come in and we will talk it
over.&rsquo; He then came in never to go out
again. I went to my little shack-room
and, locking the door, took out of a little
old hair-covered trunk a Bible my mother
had given me; it had lain there for thirty
long years untouched. I opened it and
read a while and then got down on my
knees to pray. What I said was about
like this: &lsquo;Lord, if it is really the Lord
who was talking to me (I have my doubts),
you know I am a man of my word, and you
can trust me. I want to make you a
proposition: I&rsquo;ll do the square thing by
you if you&rsquo;ll do the same by me.
Amen!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;was the beginning of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
the struggle for rest to my soul; and I
found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An incident leading to his immediate,
possibly ultimate safety, was a conversation
in a saloon. It does not always
transpire that we are benefited by the act
of the talebearer, but in this case it was
highly salutary. One of his engineer friends,
drinking at the bar, said: &ldquo;Never fear
about H&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;. He will soon get over all
this and be along with us as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing it, he became very righteously
indignant and said: &ldquo;By the grace of God,
never! I&rsquo;ll go up to the church my wife
attends and join with her, and when they
know I am a church member they&rsquo;ll let
me alone.&rdquo; He did so at once. He was
saved. He lived for many years, always
happy, always helpful, and without fear
he ascended the snowy hills of old age,
with their enveloping mists.</p>
<p>Afflicted with a creeping paralysis, he
lingered long, ever cheerful, and interested
in his friends, to whom he sent many messages.
To his brothers of the Odd Fellows
he sent this message: &ldquo;Boys, I&rsquo;ll not see
you any more. I am just like a boy at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
Christmas Eve, who with stocking hung up,
is anxious for daylight. The shadows have
come over me. My stocking is hung up
by the Father&rsquo;s fireplace and I am almost
impatient for the morning. I haven&rsquo;t the
remotest idea what I will get, but I am
sure it will be something good.&rdquo; A few
days before his translation he was visited
by one of his old-time railway associates,
who said to him: &ldquo;H&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, you are now up
against the real thing, according to your
belief; and it looks to us the same, just as
if you would have to go some one of these
days. How does it seem? What is it
like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at the questioner lovingly, the
dying man said, &ldquo;Charley, you&rsquo;ve worked
for the railway company a long time, and
never had many promotions, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, about twenty years&ndash;&ndash;and no promotions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Charley, suppose there&rsquo;d come to
you to-day a wire from headquarters saying
there&rsquo;s a big promotion waiting for you on
your arrival, and at the same time a pass
for your free transportation. How do
you think that would seem to you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;My soul, but that&rsquo;d be fine,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Charley, that&rsquo;s just my case exactly,&rdquo;
said the radiant man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
working for God and his company for about
that same length of time and never had
much promotion so far as I could see, and
now I have a summons direct from the
glory land telling me there&rsquo;s a big advancement
for me, and it sounds mighty
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was dressed for the wedding, the
Christmas morning, or whatever awaited
him, and was anxious that the couriers of
the King should come. When the moment
came the old engineer&rsquo;s headlight was undimmed,
the switch signals showed green,
and when he called for the last board at
the home station the signal came back:
&ldquo;All&rsquo;s well; come on in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had received his coveted promotion.</p>

<p>The Methodist locomotive engineer had
died joyful. &ldquo;I am so glad to go,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I am like a boy when there&rsquo;s a
circus in town; I&rsquo;ve got the price, and my
baggage is checked clear through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was holding a memorial service for him
in his old home town, and at the close a
big, broad-shouldered man came forward to
the altar rail and quietly said, &ldquo;You did
not know that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remark startled me a little, for I
had been acquainted with him for many
years; in fact, had once been his pastor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I did,&rdquo; replied I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you never really knew him,&rdquo; was
the insistent rejoinder; &ldquo;let me tell you
something about him. Years ago I was
not living as I ought, and I had all sorts of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
trouble. My wife was very sick, and we
were living in a bit of a shack back here a
little way where she finally died. I was
down and out. The fellows wanted to be
good to me, and they were&ndash;&ndash;in their way
of thinking&ndash;&ndash;but it did me no good. They
would say, &lsquo;Come, brace up, old fellow,
have a drink and forget your troubles.&rsquo;
But there are some troubles drink will not
drown; mine was one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night our friend came up to my
shack, and having visited a while he said:
&lsquo;Old man, you&rsquo;re up against it hard, ain&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;Yes, I am, just up to the
limit.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, let&rsquo;s pray about it.&rsquo; I told
him I didn&rsquo;t believe in prayer. &lsquo;All right,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;I do, and I&rsquo;ll pray any way.&rsquo; You
should have heard the prayer he made. It
was about like this: &lsquo;God, here&rsquo;s my friend,
Charley; he&rsquo;s in an awful fix. We&rsquo;ll have
to do something for him. I&rsquo;ve done all I
can; now, it&rsquo;s up to you to see him through.
Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he arose from his knees and,
handing me his check book, he said, &lsquo;My
wife and I ain&rsquo;t got much, only a couple o&rsquo;
thousand in the bank; but here&rsquo;s this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
check book all signed up; take it and use
it all if you need it, and God bless you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; added the narrator of the story,
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t use money like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tears were fast falling over his
bronzed cheeks as he told with tenderness
the story, and as I looked into his eyes I
knew that through knowledge of the dead
engineer&rsquo;s kingly kindness had come to him
the knowledge of the new life.</p>

<p>Indian character is human character because
the Indian is human. Being human
he is susceptible to all human teaching and
experiences. None yields more readily to
love and kindness.</p>
<p>Few can speak of the Indian with absolute
propriety, for very few know him.
To the mind of most Americans, I venture
to say, the very name &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; suggests
scalpings, massacres, outrages of all kinds
and an interminable list of kindred horrors;
all too true. But it must be remembered
that the Indian presented to his first discoverers
a race most tractable, tenderhearted,
and responsive to kindness. He
was indeed the child of the plain, but a
loving child.</p>
<p>The chevaliers both of Spanish and English
blood taught him in the most practical
manner the varied refinements of deceit,
treachery, and cruelty. He was an apt
scholar, and the devotee of social heredity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
which has here so striking an example,
cannot curse the redman if the sins of the
fathers are meted out to succeeding generations.</p>
<p>Under definite heads I am giving some
very brief sketches of living, down-to-date
aborigines, such as have come under my
own observation in Utah and Idaho.</p>

<p>Fort Hall Reservation, until 1902, embraced
a large territory of which Pocatello
was the center. These Idaho red people
are the remnants of the once powerful
tribes of the Bannocks and Shoshones,
which ranged from the Blue Mountains in
Oregon to the backbone of the Rocky
Mountains. The compressing processes
used by the aggressive white people have
encircled, curtailed, and squeezed their
borders so that now they are centered at
Fort Hall, half way between Pocatello and
Blackfoot. Here the government has a
school for them, and the Protestant Episcopal
Church a mission.</p>
<p>Pocatello is named for a wily old chief
of that name, who became an outlaw to
be reckoned with. He once led a cavalcade
of his sanguinary followers against the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
newly made non-Mormon town of Corinne,
Utah; but a Mormon who had been notified
of the proposed massacre, by a coreligionist,
likewise told a friend among the Gentiles,
and a precautionary counter plan was formulated.
Nothing more came of it than
an evening visit from Brigham Young and
his staff, who, as reported, pronounced and
prophesied an awful and exterminating
curse upon the town and people. However,
because of the warning, his curses
went elsewhere.</p>
<p>Until recently there lived in the region
of the city of Pocatello an old squaw-man
(white man with an Indian wife). His
home was within the borders of the reservation,
and he had been there since before
the time when the boundary line between
the United States and England (Canada)
was settled. The old man was called
&ldquo;Doc,&rdquo; and once when visiting him I said,
&ldquo;Tell me about old Pocatello, Doc, and
what became of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man, half reclining on the pile
of household debris in one corner of his
shanty, permitted me to sit by the door&ndash;&ndash;for
there were no chairs in the place. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
four corners were occupied as follows: in
one were his saddle and accouterments for
range work; in another the accumulation of
rags and blankets on which he slept (for he
lived alone now, the wife being dead); in
another was his little stove, and the last
held the door where I sat. The air was
fresher there, I thought. The veteran of
eighty or more years, bronzed by the
winds and roughened by the sweeping
sands of the desert, lighted his pipe and
said: &ldquo;It war in the days o&rsquo; them freighters
who operated &rsquo;tween Corinne an&rsquo; Virginny
City when Alder Gulch was a-goin&rsquo; chock
full o&rsquo; business. The Forwardin&rsquo; Company
hed a mighty big lot o&rsquo; rollin&rsquo; stock an&rsquo;
hosses to keep the traffic up. The hull
kentry was Injun from put-ni&rsquo; Corinne to
that there Montanny town. The Bear
Rivers an&rsquo; the Fort Hall tribes, the Bannocks
an&rsquo; the Blackfeet uste to make life
anything but a Fourth-o&rsquo;-July picnic fer
them fellers an&rsquo; their drivers. Right h&rsquo;yur
was the natterelest campin&rsquo; place fer the
Company, or, ruther, a natterel spot fer
the stage-station, where they could git the
stock fresh an&rsquo; new an&rsquo; go on, as they hed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
to do, night an&rsquo; day, so&rsquo;s to keep business
a-movin&rsquo;, ye see. Fer &rsquo;twas a mighty long
rout fer passengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Pocatello an&rsquo; his bunch o&rsquo; red
devils got into the habit o&rsquo; runnin&rsquo; off the
stock, an&rsquo; sometimes the Company&rsquo;d haf to
wait half a day to git enough teams to go
on north; or to wait till the fagged ones&rsquo;d
git a little rest an&rsquo; then push on wi&rsquo; the
same ones. Mr. Salisbury, of Salt Lake,
was the head o&rsquo; the Forwardin&rsquo; Company,
an&rsquo; he an&rsquo; his people got mighty all-fired
tired o&rsquo; that sort o&rsquo; business. Hosses was
dear them days, but Injuns was cheap; so
he told a lot o&rsquo; us&rsquo;ns he&rsquo;d like tarnation
well if this sort o&rsquo; thing&rsquo;d stop kind o&rsquo;
sudden like; an&rsquo; we planned it might be
done jist that way too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We kind o&rsquo; laid low, an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; happened
fer quite a while; but one night a
fine bunch o&rsquo; hosses was run off jist when
they&rsquo;s a big lot o&rsquo; treasure goin&rsquo; over the
line, an&rsquo; the management was sure mad.
They told us &rsquo;uns agin somethin&rsquo; had to be
done, an&rsquo; despert quick this time. So we
got busy. We begun to round ol&rsquo; Pocatello
up, an&rsquo; he seemed to smell a rat or somethin&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
wuss, an&rsquo; started up Pocatello Crick
yander, that there ca&ntilde;on, see? He went
almighty fast too when he got started; so
did we, now I tell you, an&rsquo; we jist kep&rsquo;
a-foller&rsquo;n&rsquo;, an&rsquo; foller&rsquo;n&rsquo;, an&rsquo; foller&rsquo;n&rsquo;, we did&ndash;&ndash;a
hull lot ov us&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; Pocatello
never come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the old squaw-man tapped the
ashes from his pipe, and rising said, &ldquo;Well,
I guess I&rsquo;ll cinch up the cayuse an&rsquo; ride
some this a&rsquo;ternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the many signs that the Indian is
human is his slowness to learn. Ever since
1492 the whiter man has been trying to force
some supposedly useful things into the mind
of him of the darker skin. One of these is
that he of the blanket has no rights that he
of the dress coat is bound to respect. The
Indian rises in practical debate to this
question. His arguments are not words,
but the rifle and the scalping-knife. The
whiter man demurs when he receives
his justice dished up to him in redskin
style.</p>
<p>It is unreasonable to the Indian that the
white man should take from him his hunting
grounds and limit his access to the very
streams whence his people for ages uncountable
filled their pantries for the winter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
He has learned to his disgust (without
place for repentance) that equivalents are
equivocations, and that the little baubles
the fathers of the tribes had for their
broad acres were mostly worthless. The
civilized trick of procuring the mystic sign
manual known as signature had fastened on
them the gyves of perpetual poverty.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the nation demanded
they should send their children to the
white man&rsquo;s school in the far, far away
Eastern land, where they could not see
them and from which so many of the red-faced
lads and lassies returned with that
dread disease, pulmonary tuberculosis. But
they were only Indians, and what rights
had they? When boys and girls were not
promptly surrendered, the soldiers were
sent to chase them down. It would not
seem good to us to have big, brawny
Indians on horseback give chase to our
children, and catch and tie them like so
many hogs, to be carted off to a land
unknown to us; but then these are only
Indians. That makes all the difference
imaginable.</p>
<p>Some years ago the Fort Hall Indians
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
went on their usual trip to the edge of
Yellowstone Park&ndash;&ndash;Jackson&rsquo;s Hole&ndash;&ndash;for the
purpose of laying in their annual supply of
elk and bear meat. The government had
forbidden this, yet they went, with their
indispensable paraphernalia and camp
equipage, taking the squaws (and papooses,
of course) to dress and care for whatever
of provision fell into their hands.</p>
<p>When it was discovered that the Indians
had gone in the face of the prohibitory
order the soldiers were sent to drive them
out. Such racing and chasing! &ldquo;Wild
horse, wild Indian, wild horseman,&rdquo; as
Washington Irving puts it. Every man
and woman for himself now. Papooses
were slung on the saddle-horns of their
mothers&rsquo; horses, a loop being fastened to
the back of the board to which every little
copperfaced tike was strapped. In one of
the hard flights through the thickly fallen
and storm-twisted pines, firs, and chaparral
a mother, pressed too hard by the soldiers
and cavalry, lost her baby.</p>
<p>Her tribal friends ventured back after all
was safe, and with an Indian&rsquo;s trail-finding
tact hunted high and low, far and wide,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
but no trace was ever found of the wee
baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, then, what mattered it? It was
nothing but an Indian baby, and its mother
only an Indian squaw! Who cares for a
squaw any way?&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When the &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; first went among
the Indians at Fort Hall her reception
was neither cordial nor cold, for she was
not received at all. She had not been invited
and she was not welcome. For the
first eighteen months after reaching the fort
she could often hear in the nighttime the
movement of a moccasin, as some tired
Indian spy changed his cramped position,
for she was religiously watched and irreligiously
suspected. They could not understand
why she, an unmarried white woman,
should leave her home and spend time
among them.</p>
<p>The braves strode by her in sullen silence,
eloquently impressing their contumelious
hauteur. The no less stolid squaws, who
observe everything and see nothing, disdainfully
covered their faces with their
blankets or looked in silence in the opposite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
direction when the teacher met them or
lifted the tent-flap.</p>
<p>After a long time she won her way with
some of the wee ones, and thus touched
the hearts of the mothers, through whom
she made a road broad and wide into the
affections of the tribe. They trusted her
with the secrets of the people, and she was
at home in every teepee in the reservation.
Gathering the girls together, she taught
them the beautiful words of the Bible, and
for many years she lived, loved, and labored
there.</p>
<p>Mary Muskrat was one of the Bannock
girls in the mission school. The little
shrinking, more-than-half-wild papoose of
the desert had been toilsomely but surely
trained by the teacher, that bravest of
little women.</p>
<p>Pulmonary consumption is the bane of
the civilized Indians. It carries them off
in multitudes. Despite their outdoor living,
it seems that few, if any, ever recover from
an attack. The dread disease had fastened
itself upon Mary and she was sick unto
death. Her little shack was no fit place
for a living person, and here was one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
dying. Frequent visits from her teacher
afforded the dying maiden her only relief.
Once, after watching her through a severe
paroxysm of coughing, it seemed that life
had gone completely. Removing the
squalid bunch of rags which served as a
pillow, and lowering the head, the devoted
teacher stood watching the supposed lifeless
form. But she saw the lips moving, and,
bending low, she heard the dying girl whisper,
&ldquo;What time I am afraid I will trust in
Thee.&rdquo; Continuing, she breathed out, &ldquo;The
Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want....
Yea, though I walk through the valley
and the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.&rdquo;
Pausing, while the heart of the white
woman was praising God for his goodness
to the dusky child, Mary opened her beautiful
eyes, and, seeing her protectress and

<h2>BAD BEN</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A little child shall lead them.&ndash;&ndash;<i>Isaiah</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ben&rsquo;s daughter, Mary<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>, was the delight
of the old man&rsquo;s heart. She had been
taken most unwillingly, so far as both
were concerned, and placed in one of the
Eastern schools for Indian youths. Ben
had objected strenuously, but the stronger
arm prevailed.</p>
<p>The teacher at the mission had never in
all her many years in that place felt fear
until after Mary was taken away. When
the father would come to the school to
ask for news of her, he had his face painted
black, indicating madness or war&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;bad
heart&rdquo; he called it. The little woman who
had won the hearts of the people did not
know what the enraged man might do or
when he would do it. Once, after many
such terrifying visits, he volunteered the
information that he was making him a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
house and a farm &ldquo;all same witee man.&rdquo;
He had built it of some railroad ties he had
found and had begun to cultivate a garden
and cut some wild hay. &ldquo;Me makee heap
good wikiup, all same witee man; Mary
he all same witee squaw, by &rsquo;um by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white plague is the only disease the
Indian fears or calls sickness. Once, when
Ben went to the school where a dozen or so
other happy-faced little girls were being
taught and prepared for the Eastern school,
Miss F&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; was obliged to tell him Mary
was sick. For a while his savagery was
apparently renewed. He became wild again.
His visits increased in frequency, and all
the time the teacher was in mental torture,
for he seemed to feel that the white woman
was in some manner connected with his
child&rsquo;s going away and her present condition.</p>
<p>The dread day came when she must tell
the loving father that there was now no
hope for his &ldquo;lil&rsquo; gal,&rdquo; as he affectionately
called her. Then another more dreaded day
rolled round, and the last story must be
told: Mary had died. She would be buried
in the far east. Poor old father! He could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
not even see her then. How could he be
made to understand?</p>
<p>The only solution of the problem was the
holding of a memorial service for her. One
of the Pocatello pastors went up to hold
such a service at the Agency and Ben was
present. He was told that if he lived with
his heart clean, &ldquo;no have bad heart,&rdquo; he
would see his Mary again. No one could
tell to what extent this message found place
in his mind until later. One day he was
seen approaching the mission school slowly
and apparently sorrowful. Miss F&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; met
him at the door. On entering he said, &ldquo;O,
Miss F&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, bad Injun no liky me have hay,
no liky me have wikiup all same witee man.
Bad Injun burn me up; all me wikiup, all
me hay, all me everyt&rsquo;ing. But me no
have bad heart [that means, &ldquo;I do not hate
them&rdquo;], me no have bad heart, Miss F&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;;
me no have bad heart; me want see my lil&rsquo;
gal some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the lonesome man went away to his
one-time home to try to live among the
unchristian and unprogressive Indians without
having any hatred toward them, for he
wanted to meet his Mary.</p>

<p>A peculiar wireless telegraphy has ever
been in vogue among the aborigines of
many lands. The interior tribes of Africa
have it and use it to perfection. The
plains Indians and those of the mountains
know its use, and messages are sent which
cause much wonderment to the white man.</p>
<p>In 1899 the ghost-dancing was in progress
among all the Indians of the United States.
All Indiandom was excited to the highest
degree. Disturbances among them were
watched and feared by the government.
The Bannocks and Shoshones of Fort Hall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
were nerved to a high tension and quickly
athrill to any new movement. Hearing that
an unusual interest was being displayed
among the Nez Perces of the north, a
committee of the Fort Hall men was sent
to ascertain what it was. It proved to be
a revival of religion conducted by the
Presbyterians. The committee was composed
of heathens, but they saw, were
conquered, and came home reporting it
was good, and requested that there be
similar meetings held among them. It was
so planned and arranged. A Nez Perce
Presbyterian minister was to be their visitant
evangelist.</p>
<p>The various Protestant churches in Pocatello
had been by turns supplying preaching
to the people of Fort Hall&rsquo;s tribes, and to
the whites who were the residents at Ross
Fork, the seat of the Agency. On the
particular evening when the special meetings
were to begin it was the turn of the
writer to preach. The Rev. James Hays,
a full-blood Nez Perce, was there as evangelist.
But he could not speak a word of
the Bannock-Shoshone mixed jargonized
dialect. He had been educated in English
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
and could understand me so as to interpret,
rather translate into Nez Perce, but who
could reach the people to whom we had
the message? There was present a renegade
fellow, Pat Tyhee (big Pat, or chief Pat),
<i>not an Irishman</i>. He was a Shoshone who
years before had gone to live among the
Nez Perces and had married a woman of
them. He could interpret Hays, but could
he be trusted? He was a very heathenish
heathen. The missionary teacher, Miss
Frost, consulted with Mr. Hays and myself
as to the wisdom of asking Pat to play
interpreter for the momentous occasion;
after fervently praying we concluded to
take the risk and trust to God&rsquo;s leading.
Pat, the heathen, was chosen. It was a
queer audience. There were some whites,
some Indians. It was odd to see Gun, the
Agency policeman, there with his only
prisoner. There were Billy George, the
tribal judge; and Hubert Tetoby, the assistant
blacksmith, as well as others of
local importance. To add to the excitement
of the evening, it was the night before
ration day at the Agency, when all the
Indians from the entire Reservation were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
present&ndash;&ndash;fifteen hundred of them&ndash;&ndash;for their
share. It was a wild time&ndash;&ndash;the raw
blanketed man was there for a Saturnalia.
He knew no law but his desires. The
unprotected young woman had no security
from him. Indeed, while we were gathering
in the mission house for this service, I
noticed a slight stirring at my feet, and
looked, and there was Mary, a young
widow, who had scuttled in silent as a
partridge and was snuggling down on the
floor just back of my feet, successful in
getting away from some red Lothario who
had pursued her to the door.</p>
<p>The service began. I preached from the
words of Martha to Mary, &ldquo;The Master is
come and is calling for thee.&rdquo; It was an
attempt to show that Jesus needs us as
living agents to work with him. Mr. Hays,
I suppose, and always have believed, translated
to Pat in Nez Perce what I said.
Pat in turn interpreted to the assembled
band of mixed Indians. To be sure, I
understood not a thing either said: but
when I looked at the earnest, love-ridden,
and sweat-covered face of the yearning Nez
Perce, I believed that what he was saying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
was all I said and more. And Pat&ndash;&ndash;he was
a sight! Had his hands been tied, I really
believed he could not have expressed himself
at all. He is about six feet six in his moccasins,
and those long arms accompanied
the lengthy guttural expressions in an intensely
effective manner. At the close of
the three-cornered sermon the question was
asked, &ldquo;How many of you from this time
forward are willing to follow Jesus and be
known as his assistants?&rdquo; Among the most
prominent and enthusiastic replies that
came were those of Hubert Tetoby, Billy
George, <i>and Pat Tyhee, the heathen interpreter</i>.
Looking me straight in the eyes,
swerving neither to the one side nor the
other, these madly-in-earnest men of the
mountains held their hands up high as
they could reach them. And in six weeks
from that date there was a Presbyterian
church there composed of sixty-five members,
of whom only one, the teacher, Miss
Frost, was white; and Pat Tyhee was
made one of the elders. There had been
no Christians there at all before those
meetings. It was an Indian Pentecost.</p>

<p>Some hypercritical person, and possibly
some sincere soul, may ask: &ldquo;Did such
revival do any permanent good? Does not
the so-near savage easily backslide?&rdquo; To
this may be given this partial reply: It
depends somewhat on the sort of white
folks there are in the immediate vicinity.
As elsewhere stated in these pages, the pale
face has been the great undoer of the
red man. &ldquo;Civilization&rdquo; in some garbs is
worse than savagery. The white skin has
been the password for some awful systems
of debauchery among the aborigines of
America. An Indian speaker, and chief of
police of one of the Indian reservations of
Oregon, said at the Second World&rsquo;s Christian
Citizenship Conference in Portland,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
1913: &ldquo;Before the white man came the
Indian had no jails or locks on their doors.
The white man brought whisky; there is
now need of both jails and locks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About three years after the meeting at
Fort Hall, where the three-cornered sermon
was delivered, Mr. Roosevelt made a visit
to the West. Major A. F. Caldwell, Agent
of Indian Affairs at Fort Hall, told the
fourteen hundred red natives that if they
would turn out in their handsomest manner,
he would give them all a &ldquo;big eat&rdquo;
after the visit. Promptly on the day designated
the famous rough rider and the
desert riders were in evidence, the latter
in abundance. They went far out along
the railway to meet the train, and then
galloped their wiry, pintoed ponies along
by the side of the car, performing many
feats of daring horsemanship, throwing
themselves from the flying bronchos and
remounting without a pause, and other
stunts which they invented. After the
&ldquo;pageant had fled&rdquo; the expectant and
hungry Indians were herded into a large
vacant lot in Pocatello, where all sorts of
provisions had been collected for the feast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
I was anxious to see them, and so were
many other equally bold and possibly a
wee bit impolite people, for when they
had assembled a great crowd of curious
white folks was there gazing.</p>
<p>The Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association
secretary and I overlooked the scene from
a hotel whose wall formed one side of the
enclosure where the long tables of loose
planks were laid. All was hurry, bustle,
and confusion, not much unlike what everyone
has witnessed at the ordinary picnic.</p>
<p>The Christians and the non-Christians
had divided as though not of the same
tribe or blood. These had their tables on
one side, those on the opposite. When all
was ready the savage part of the divided
company fell to with vim, vigor, and haste,
just as white people often do at outdoor
dinners; but see the others! After all had
been carefully spread, odorous cans of
tempting viands opened, and everything
adjusted, the hungry horde was seated. A
low word of attention was given by some
one; every head was bowed, quiet was
absolute, and Billy George in guttural tones
said something the Lord of all could understand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
When he was through these also
fell to with an unmistakable zest and the
day ended merrily for the Indians and
profitably for some of the onlookers.</p>
<p>This Billy George was crippled by the
bullets of some of the reservation Indians
who did not like his progressive ways. He
had lost one leg for this reason. One night,
as he was fastening up his animals, he
stooped to lift one of the bars of his corral.
Just as he raised himself, a shot that was
doubtless meant for his lowered head struck
his leg and it had to be amputated.</p>
<p>On the night of his conversion, when he
had raised his hand high as he could reach,
he in the after meeting mimicked the white
folks who had slowly and with many side-lookings
so slightly moved their hands upward.
He said, &ldquo;Huh, white folks heap
scared, do this way;&rdquo; and he imitated them
grotesquely.</p>
<p>Often when leaving his teepee for the hills
in order to haul his winter wood, he would
go to the home of Miss F&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, the missionary,
and tell her he was going away,
and at the same time asking her to be sure
to care for his squaw and papooses if he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
did not return; for, said he, &ldquo;Bad Injun
ketchy me some day; no liky me; you savy
me liky whity man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So fair of mind was he, and so humanely
progressive, that the government had chosen
him as one of the men before whom petty
cases among the tribe were taken. If he
could not solve the problems, they were
then carried to the Agent; then on up if
not there adjusted.</p>
<p>When the Presbyterian Missionary Board
assisted these Christians to build a neat
house of worship it was, and still is, known
far and near as Billy George&rsquo;s Church.</p>

<h2>CHIEF JOSEPH AND HIS LOST WALLOWA</h2>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Land where my fathers died.&ndash;&ndash;<i>Smith</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Cornishman was once asked why there
were no public houses (saloons) in his town.
He replied, &ldquo;Once a man by the name of
John Wesley preached here, and there have
been none since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once a man by the name of General
O. O. Howard passed through eastern
Oregon and northern Idaho, and the country
has not been the same since. The occasion
was the uprising of the Nez Perces
Indians in 1877. Ridpath, the historian,
tells of the long chase of the red men and
the weary pursuit of &ldquo;sixteen hundred
miles.&rdquo; It was truly a Fabian retreat on
the part of Chief Joseph and his band, but
General Howard was dealing mercifully with
them; at a dozen places he could have given
battle, but he spared the useless slaughter,
avoiding the needless scaring of the white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
settlers and the complement of dire scenes
and death that would necessarily follow.</p>
<p>The story of Chief Joseph is one of the
most interesting unwritten chapters in the
history of the great Northwest. The fact
of the capture of this wily Indian leader
with most of his band is well known. They
were banished from the Alpine regions of
eastern Oregon and compelled to make
their home across the marble ca&ntilde;on of the
Snake in the State of Idaho, far from their
loved Wallowa.</p>
<p>The valley of Wallowa (an Indian name)
is one of the most beautiful spots imaginable.
At its southern end stand pillared
peaks, eternally snow-crowned, rivaling the
finest to be seen in Switzerland. Here lies
the limpid, glassy Lake Wallowa, near the
busy town of Joseph, so named in honor of
the great chieftain. This emerald valley
nestles in the lap of the Blue Mountains,
and was from time immemorial the favorite
home of the exiled natives. When Bonneville
passed through that remote region in
the early thirties they were in the enjoyment
of that valley and the rugged recesses
of the Imnaha between Oregon and Walla
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
Walla. The famous red fish, the yank, and
others possibly peculiar to the place were
found in abundance in the lake. It was
their treasure house for finny food, and
the hovering hills furnished flesh of deer
and bear.</p>
<p>At a point in the valley twenty miles
north of the lake, Old Joseph, father of the
more famous son, lies buried; his bramble-covered
grave is to be seen by the roadside
to-day. For this reason something more
than an instinctive affection dominated the
heart of the younger man.</p>
<p>Not long before his death, accompanied
by guards, Chief Joseph was taken into the
valley on some sort of errand, and was
thus permitted to see again the enchanting
beauties of his birthplace and early home.
How hungry were his eyes as he viewed the
great opaline pool which reflected the
sinewy cedars and pointed pines; as he
looked upon the surrounding glen, the ancient
game-range, the distant dissolving
plain, the hills heightening through their
timber-covered sides up to the very sky!
His bursting heart cried out, &ldquo;I have but
one thing to ask for from the White Father:
Give me this lake and the land around it,
and some few acres surrounding the grave
of my father.&rdquo;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>The white man&rsquo;s ax had cleared the
timber about the old man&rsquo;s grave; the
white man&rsquo;s plow might menace the sacred
sod above the mute dust of his honored
sire. He wished to protect that place hallowed
by love&ndash;&ndash;his own father&rsquo;s grave. But
his plea was denied. He was not permitted
to have what in all reason seemed his very
own.</p>
<p>He was now an old man, with eyes that
had never shed tears, a soul that was unacquainted
with fear, and a heart that had
never weakened in the presence of danger.
But at the thought that he was no more to
see his lovely Wallowa his eyes melted, his
soul sank, his heart broke.</p>
<p>Chief Joseph died near Spokane not many
years since, wailing out the one great desire
of his life, a final glimpse of the land of his
birth, the hunting ground of his manhood
and the graves of his sires.</p>

<p>Having heard the early explorers speak
of God, the Bible, and religion, and knowing
that on Sundays the flag was raised and
work suspended, the Indians wanted to
know more about these things, and two
chiefs, Hee-oh&rsquo;ks-te-kin (Rabbit-skin Leggins)
and H&rsquo;co-a-h&rsquo;co-a-cotes-min (No-horns-on-his-Head)
set out to find the
white missionaries who could inform their
troubled minds. They did not reach Saint
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
Louis until 1832, where they found General
Clark, whom they had known. The messengers
were of the Nez Perce tribe. General
Clark took them to the cathedral and
showed them the pictures of the saints and
entertained them in the best and most approved
Christian style; but they were heart-hungry
and went home dissatisfied. One of
them made the following speech to the
kindly soldier, General Clark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to you over a trail of many
moons from the setting sun. You were the
friend of my fathers who have all gone the
long way. I came with one eye partly
opened, for more light for my people who
sit in darkness. I go back with both eyes
closed. How can I go back with both eyes
closed? How can I go back blind to my
blind people? I made my way to you with
strong arms, through many enemies and
strange lands, that I might carry much
back to them. I go back with both arms
broken and empty. The two fathers who
came with us&ndash;&ndash;the braves of many winters
and wars&ndash;&ndash;we leave asleep by your great
water and wigwam.<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> They were tired in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
many moons, and their moccasins wore out.
My people sent me to get the white man&rsquo;s
Book of heaven. You took me where you
allow your women to dance, as we do not
ours, and the Book was not there; you
showed me the images of the good spirits
and the pictures of the good land beyond,
but the Book was not among them to tell
us the way. I am going back the long, sad
trail to my people of the dark land. You
make my feet heavy with the burden of
gifts, and my moccasins will grow old in
carrying them, but the Book is not among
them. When I tell my poor, blind people,
after one more snow, in the big council,
that I did not bring the Book, no word
will be spoken by our old men or our young
braves. One by one they will rise up and
go out in silence. My people will die in
darkness, and they will go on the long
path to the other hunting grounds. No
white man will go with them and no white
man&rsquo;s Book will make the way plain. I
have no more words.&rdquo;</p>

timber line, stand motherlike, or bishoplike,
crozier-cragged, shepherding the verdant
uplands and the velvety valleys whose
billowy meadows bend beneath the highland
zephyrs or fall before the scythe of
the prospering farmer. Now he beholds
the ruggedest of capacious ca&ntilde;ons where
the rollicking rivers and rhythmic rills have
cut great gorges deep into the rocky ribs of
the tightly hugging hills. Another turn
and he sees the hearty herds transforming
themselves automatically into gold for their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
happy owners; another turn shows the lazy
rivers arising from their age-long beds and
mossy couches to climb the hot hillsides and
to toil and sweat at the command of the
lord of this world, as they irrigate his arid
acres. Yet another turn and the wrathful
river is carrying on its breast the tens of
thousands of winter-cut logs dancing like
straws on its frothy surface on their way
to the busy mills; and the turbulent
streams, their wildness tamed and harnessed,
serve the needs of man like trusted
domestic servants.</p>
<p>But this is not the way to view mountains;
it is only surface sights we get in this
manner. He who would know the beauties
of the hills must become acquainted with
them personally <i>and on foot</i>. Anyone can
enjoy the lazy luxury of the cozy precincts
of an upholstered, porter-served car. He
may travel horseback or donkey-back, if he
cares to visit only where such sure-footed
animals can go. However, when I want to
see the stately things among the unchiseled
palaces and temples where Nature pays
homage in the courts of the Divine Architect,
I dismiss all modes of conveyance, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
with well-nailed shoes, rough clothes, a
staff, and a lunch, I take the kingdom by
force. When once in, I am royally entertained;
for though coy and apparently hard
to woo, Nature is a most delightful companion
when once you are acquainted.</p>

<p>So sang Longfellow. Bishop Warren said
that every peak tempted him as with a
beckoning finger, daring him to a climb.</p>
<p>To those who have never been nearer the
unlocked fastnesses of our eternal American
hills than by the too common means above
mentioned, the far-away cliffs of marble or
white granite, with their areas of unmeltable
snows and ices, look temptingly down
on us in August, together with the smaller
and less inspiring crags. But when we approach
them, even those nearest, how they
appear to recede&ndash;&ndash;almost to run away!
The high peaks that looked as though
climbing up and peeping over the heads of
the lower ones, either jump down and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
bashfully run to hide, or the little ones
rise up to protect them. So it seems as one
approaches.</p>
<p>Entering the mountain side by way of a
yawning ca&ntilde;on we soon come to a sheer
precipice lying in a deep gorge with perpendicular
sides, while, leaping from the
top of the declivity high above our heads, as
if from the very zenith, a stream of crystal
water cleaves the air. It is dashed into
countless strands of silvery pearls before
it reaches the deep bed of moss spread
down to receive it, and where it lies resting
awhile for its downward journey toward
the moon-whipped ocean.</p>
<p>Ah, Longfellow! You have taught us
how to climb some mountains, but here we
have to construct our ladders, for anyone
less sure of foot than the chamois or the
mountain sheep must stay at the bottom
of the falls. Scylla and Charybdis are stationary
now, and the gaping chasm has
swallowed us upward, where we reach an
opening into a wide park, a veritable fairyland.
On the top of one of those ponderous
laminations tilted edgewise is the king of
the gnomes of the new glen. We call him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
Pharaoh. How archly he looks out over
his wide domain! His kingly cap is adorned
with a cobra ready to strike, yet out on his
ample breast floats a most royal but un-Pharonic
beard. This is one of the ways
the quondam haughty hills have of providing
entertainment for the bold questioner
and visitor.</p>
<p>The scenery is always new. High rocks,
whose rugged faces look as if their titanic
architect had been surprised and driven
away while as yet his task was not half
completed; long gaping gulches lined with
an evergreen decoration of spruce, cedar,
manzanita, and mountain mahogany, are
some of the sidelights to be found in a
day&rsquo;s journey in the realms adjacent to
the Old Oregon Trail.</p>

<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:2em;font-size:1.4em;'>THE STAGECOACH</p>
<p>At frequent intervals throughout the
widening West may be seen the relegated
ship of the desert standing forlorn, friendless,
forsaken. The merciless claws of
summer and the icy fangs of winter are
loosening the red paint, and the white
canvas cover and side curtains are flapping
in the winds. The tired tongue, dumb
with age and years of use, still tells tales
of hardships by the silent eloquence of its
multitude of unhealed scars.</p>
<p>This class of carryall was at once unique
and supreme. It was the one indispensable
link in the endless chain of evolution popular
and powerful, the only public agent of the
Trail and the plains until the unconquerable
initiative of the lord of the world had
time to steel a highway with trackage for
more rapid transit. What a living link was
that old overland stage! To look upon an
isolated and abandoned relic of earlier pioneerdom
is like standing at the marble monument
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
of some human pivot in the mighty
march of man&rsquo;s progress. Before the bold
and bustling railway noisily elbowed its
way into the affections of travel and commerce
and pushed aside the patient wagon
of the nation-builders, the tens of thousands
of hurried travelers enjoyed (or endured)
the hospitality of its rocking thorough-braces
as they, hour by hour, day after
day, and night after night, and even week
after week in the longer journeys, sat atop
or inside this leviathan of the sand-ocean
making the most rapid trip possible and
under safe guidance.</p>
<p>Could such old hulk tell its story, could
that dried-up old tongue but begin to wag
again, what tales! First would come those
of the men too often overworked and underappreciated,
like our modern railmen, the
drivers of the stage. These, as the ancient
Jehu, were compelled to drive furiously on
occasion, in order to keep a cramped
schedule or make up for the loss of time
brought about by a breakdown, a washout,
or some Indian depredation. Few drivers
there were who did not love their work. It
came to be a saying, &ldquo;Once a driver, always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
a driver.&rdquo; The coach-and-four, or more,
with booted and belted man on the throne
of the swinging chariot, made every boy
envious and created in him a desire to become
great some day too. Eagle and Dick,
Tom and Rock, Bolly and Bill understood
the snap of the whip, or its more wicked
crack, as well as they did the tension of the
line or the word of the chief charioteer,
who, with foot on the long brake-beam,
regulated the speed of the often crowded
vehicle down the precipitous places which
to the novice looked very dangerous. But
Jehu is no longer universal king. A Pharaoh
who knew him not has heartlessly and definitely
usurped some of his places.</p>
<p>In the boot of this old seaworthy craft
was hauled many a load of treasure, for the
gold-hungry prospector without sextant and
chain surveyed the fastnesses of the hills
as well as the illimitation of the prairies,
and a care-taking government made a way
to his camp to send him his mail. Express
companies joined their traffic to that of
Uncle Sam, and he of the pick and shovel
became the lodestone to popular convenience.
With many a load of treasure went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
a man known as a messenger, who sat beside
the driver, carrying a sawed-off gun under
his coat, ready to meet the gangster or
holdup, who so often robbed both stage and
passenger.</p>
<p>In the hold of this old coach have ridden
governors, statesmen of all grades, men and
women, good and better (some bad and
worse); here were bridal tours, funeral parties,
commercial men and gamblers, miners
and prospectors, Chinamen and Indians,
pleasure-seekers and labor-hunters, officers
and convicts.</p>

<p>is the way Saxe punningly puts it; but
more of a leveler was this old coach, for
there was of necessity the forceful putting
of people of the most heterogeneous character
together in the most homogeneous
manner as the omnibus (most literal word
here), made up its hashy load at the hand
and command of the driver, whose word
was unappealable law as complete as that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
of another captain on the high seas. Prodigal,
profligate, and pure, maiden or Magdalene,
millionaire or Lazarus, all were
crowded together as the needs of the hour
and the size of the passengers demanded,
to sit elbow to elbow, side by side to the
journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>Huddled thus, they traveled unchanged
till the stage station was reached; here the
horses were exchanged for fresher ones;
the wayside inn had its tables of provisions
varying and varied as the region traversed.
If in the mountains, there were likely to
be trout, saddle of deer, steaks of bear;
but if through the sands, there was provided
bacon or other coarser fare. Usually
these crowds were joking and jolly, unless
tempered by something requiring more sobriety,
but always optimistic, for the fellow
who became grouchy the while had generally
abundant occasion to repent and
mend his ways.</p>
<p>One day, on a road not far from where
this is being written, the old coach was
toiling up a long mountainside; the driver
was drowsy and the passengers had exhausted
their newest r&eacute;pertoire of stories
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
and had lapsed into stillness such as often
seizes a squeezed crowd. The horses were
permitted to take their time; the dust was
deep, the sun hot, and all possible stillness
prevailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; ordered a low voice very near
the road.</p>
<p>The driver, Tom Myers, did not understand
the command, and simply looked up,
half asleep, and said to the horses, &ldquo;Gid-dap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; came the words again, louder and
unmistakable.</p>
<p>Myers halted. Standing at the end of
an elongated bunch of pines where he had
been invisible until the heads of the horses
appeared stood the highwayman, with
menacing gun covering the head of the
driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw out your treasure and mail!&rdquo;
came the command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have mail, but no treasure,&rdquo; said my
friend Tom, as he afterward pointed out
the spot and told the story. &ldquo;Come and
get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lone robber rifled the sacks, turned
the pockets of the travelers inside out, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
bade them drive on without imitating Lot&rsquo;s
wife; he was never caught.</p>
<p>To be sure, this is a tame story, and
many readers doubtless can tell one more
thrilling; but this one is true.</p>
<p>The stagecoach is a thing of the past,
but we still have the hardy, dust-covered,
mud-daubed teamster, who yet must haul
the freight far back into hills where for
ages there will be no railway. To these,
Godspeed and good cheer! They live by
the Trails; they eat at the wheel; they
sleep under the wagon; they are kindly
and obliging even when their heavily belled
teams of six to fourteen or more head of
horses meet another loaded caravan in some
narrow pass where the highest engineering
ability is needed to get by in safety; and
they never leave a fellow-traveler in distress.</p>

<h2>THE TRAIL OF THE MORMON</h2>
</div>
<p>By the Trail had gone Jason Lee, in
1834, to plant the sturdy oak of Methodism
in the Willamette Valley and the north
Pacific Coast. His task was nobly done;
the developments of to-day attest the wisdom
of the church in sending him and his
coequal coadjutors, Daniel Lee, Cyrus
Shepherd, and P. L. Edwards.</p>
<p>Over this same track went Marcus Whitman,
in 1835, to found the mission at
Waiilatpu, near the present site of Walla
Walla, and to find there the early grave of
honorable martyrdom at the hands of the
people he was attempting to save. The
call to these two intrepid equals, Lee and
Whitman, came through the visit of the
two young Indian chiefs who, immediately
after the expedition of Lewis and Clark,
had gone to Saint Louis to obtain a copy
of the &ldquo;white man&rsquo;s Book of heaven.&rdquo; The
names of these two, as previously stated,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
were Hee-oh&rsquo;ks-te-kin and H&rsquo;co-a-h&rsquo;co-a-cotes-min.</p>
<p>On the sixth day of April, 1830, in Kirkland,
Ohio, Joseph Smith, Jr., had organized
the body best known as the Mormon
Church. Fourteen years later he was
mercilessly, and unjustly, mobbed at Nauvoo,
Illinois, and after three more years of
drifting about from pillar to post, the
Latter-Day Saints prepared to emigrate to
upper California under the absolute domination
and guidance of Brigham Young,
who was often styled the successor to the
&ldquo;Mohammed of the West,&rdquo; as Joseph Smith
was sometimes called. This cult had some
queer traits. W. W. Phelps, one of their
more prominent members, thus characterized
the leaders of Mormondom: Brigham
Young, the Lion of the Lord; P. P. Pratt,
the Archer of Paradise; O. Hyde, the Olive
Branch of Israel; W. Richards, the Keeper
of the Rolls; J. Taylor, Champion of Right;
W. Smith, the Patriarchal Jacob&rsquo;s Staff; W.
Woodruff, the Banner of the Gospel; G. A.
Smith, the Entablature of Truth; O. Pratt,
the Gauge of Philosophy; J. E. Page, the
Sun Dial; L. Wright, Wild Mountain Ram.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>Expelled from Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri,
the trembling Saints sought less
turbulent surroundings by immersing their
all in the wild conditions both of men and
wilderness in the untamed lands of the
great West. They were not able to sustain
the physical cost of the trek of more
than a thousand miles under the hardest
of circumstances. The Trail was the home
of the Sioux, the Cheyennes, the Arapahoes,
the Otoes, Omahas, Utes, and others, who
knew neither law nor mercy. The waters
were often alkaline and deadly as Lethe.
A thousand miles afoot was the record
some had to make. They appealed to the
government, then at war with Mexico, to
permit a number of their men to enlist as
soldiers to be marched over the ancient
Santa Fe Trail, and thus be able to draw
wages on the journey. This was granted.
These recruits had little, if anything, to do,
but they are known in history as the Mormon
battalion. They went to California,
1847-49, and were present when James
Marshall discovered gold at Sutter&rsquo;s Mill.</p>
<p>In 1847, July 24, Mormondom threw up
its first trenches in the valley of the Great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
Salt Lake, as that saline body was then
known and recorded. In this salubrious
region was planted the analogy of the
harem of Mohammed, and the seraglio of
Brigham became the center of the sensual
system of the Latter-Day Saints. So
blatant was the apostle Heber Kimball that
he said he himself had enough wives to whip
the soldiers of the United States.</p>
<p>Evangelical Christianity waited almost
twenty years before an attempt was made
to plant the high standards of Christendom
in the Wahsatch Mountains. In the sixties
went the denominations in the order
here named: Congregational, Protestant
Episcopal, Methodist Episcopal; in 1871
the Presbyterians went, and then the Baptists.
It was dark. Mighty night had beclouded
the intellect and obscured the
spiritual senses; civilized sensuality swayed
with unchecked hand the destinies of the
masses. The blinded people groped for
light in the pitchlike blackness of the new
superstition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None but Americans on guard&rdquo; in such
a night! Hear the roll call. None but
tried and true Christian soldiers were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
mounted on those ramparts: Erastus Smith,
the heart-winner; Thomas Wentworth Lincoln,
the scholarly but quiet Grand Army
man, who always kept his patriotic fires
banked; George Ellis Jayne, another veteran
of the Civil War, tireless evangelist
who possibly saw more Mormons made
Christian than any other pastor of any
church in Utah; George Marshall Jeffrey,
eternally at it; Joseph Wilks, methodic, patient,
sunny; Martinus Nelson, weeping over
the straying of his Norwegians; Emil E.
M&ouml;rk, rugged and steadfast; Martin Anderson
and Samuel Hooper, both of whom died
by the Trail, falling at the &ldquo;post of honor.&rdquo;
Last, but not least of these to be named,
stands the energetic and &ldquo;Boanergetic&rdquo;
Thomas Corwin Iliff, that Buckeye stentor
and patriot, who with heart-thrilling tones
has raised millions of dollars in aiding and
in establishing hundreds and hundreds of
churches in these United States. For
thirty years he commanded the Methodist
as well as the patriotic redoubts of Utah
and bearded the &ldquo;Lion of the Lord&rdquo; in his
very den.</p>
<p>But there were never truer watchmen on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
the high-towered battlements of the real
Zion than the Protestant Episcopal Bishop,
Daniel S. Tuttle; the knightly Hawkes of
the Congregationalists; the truly apostolic
Baptist, Steelman; the Presbyterian leaders&ndash;&ndash;who
surpasses them? See the saintly
Wishard, the polemic McNiece and McLain;
the scholarly and tireless Paden!</p>
<p>They were loyal to the core, commanding
the Christian forces as they deployed, enfiladed,
charged, marched, and stormed the
trenches of religious libertinism in the fertile
and paradisaical valleys and roomy ca&ntilde;ons
of the Mormon state of Deseret. These
never surrendered, compromised, or retreated.</p>
<p>Glorious Brotherhood! Permit us the

<p>The abode of the dead, where they remained
in full consciousness of their condition
for indefinable periods, or even for
eternity, has been the theme of many a
writer both before and after the advent of
the Saviour of men. Annihilation is repugnant
to the common intelligence. Homer
sends Ulysses, Dantelike, to the realms of
the dead, where he converses with them he
had known in life. The Stygian River, the
dumb servitor, Charon, the coin-paid fare,
are all well known in the classics of the
ancients.</p>
<p>In some later religio-philosophic studies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
the names are different; some have tartarus,
some purgatory, some paradise. The last
is the name adopted by the Mormons.</p>
<p>The heroes of Homer seemed never to
hope for a release from the bonds of Hades.
Voluptuous Circe, the Odysseyan swine-maker,
told the hero of those tales he was
a daring one:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;... who, yet alive, have gone<br />
Down to the abode of Pluto; twice to die<br />

</td></tr></table>
<p>Many well meaning minds have tried to
discover in the Bible, or otherwise reasonably
invent a second probation for the
unrepentant as an addendum to the final
resurrection of the just. Not a little has
been made of the term &ldquo;spirits in prison&rdquo;
(1 Pet. 3. 19, 20), and of &ldquo;baptism for the
dead&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15. 29). In the intensity of
zeal, or as a proselyting advertisement, the
Latter-Day Saints proclaim the possibility
of all the inhabitants of the grave (paradise)
being saved in heaven. To this end,
early in the history of the organization,
there was implanted the doctrine of preaching
to the departed and that of proxy
ministrations.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>From their Articles of Faith I take these
two:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3. We believe that through the atonement of
Christ all mankind may be saved by obedience to
the laws and ordinances of the gospel.</p>
<p>4. We believe that these ordinances are: First,
Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance;
third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of
sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the
Holy Ghost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, since without immersion there is
no remission of sins, and since they who
are in prison (paradise) are eligible to salvation,
therefore some one must be baptized
for them and have all the other rites
of the plan likewise administered in their
name. That &ldquo;all things may be done decently
and in order,&rdquo; there was received a
&ldquo;revelation&rdquo; to the end that temples must
be built, recorders and other officials appointed,
and all the paraphernalia necessary
for the work prepared. When these
rites are consummated some elder of the
church who dies goes to the spiritual
prison house and tells the people therein
confined that these most meritorious works
have been done for them on earth; in fact,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
this is the chief reason for their going
thither. They who will believe this story
and repent of their sins are then and there
entitled to &ldquo;a right to the tree of life, and
may enter in through the gates into the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only are the people redeemed from
all their sins by the pious ministrations of
the many temple-workers, who, like Samuel,
continually serve and minister therein,
but as marriage relations are to continue
throughout the endless ages of eternity, and
children are to be born forever and ever,
these dead have the hymeneal ceremony
performed &ldquo;for eternity&rdquo;; this act is known
as the &ldquo;sealing&rdquo; process. Men are here
married&ndash;&ndash;by proxy&ndash;&ndash;to others than the actual
living wife, sometimes with her consent,
sometimes without it. One old gentleman,
whose name is not to be mentioned,
was sealed thus for eternity to Martha
Washington and to Empress Josephine. It
sounds farcical and foolish in the extreme;
fit only to be counted as a silly joke, unworthy
the attention of a sane soul for a
minute; but it is terribly sober when it is
remembered that there are hundreds of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
thousands of innocent, honest, and unsuspecting
Mormons who really and truly believe
this to be the only road to eternal
life and exaltation.</p>
<p>Added to this is the doctrine of the deification
of men. All the true and faithful
Mormons are to become gods by and by,
and create and populate new worlds; hence
the value of polygamy; in fact, this world
is but one of the samples of this truth.
Adam is the owner and ruler of earth, and
to him we pray. He is our God. As such
he is only one in an endless procession of
such beings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been and there now exists an
endless procession of the Gods, stretching
back into the eternities, that had no beginning
and will have no end. Their existence
runs parallel with endless duration,
and their dominions are limitless as boundless
space.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a></p>
<p>Possibly the most popular hymn among
these people is the following, written by
one of the wives of Joseph Smith, Eliza R.
Snow. It is in their collection and now in

<p>When Mormonism was no longer compelled
to maintain the defensive it quickly
assumed the offensive. This was apparently
deemed necessary for the existence of
the system. Two kinds of preaching were
indulged in by the elders on their missions,
home and foreign. At home they declared
the beauty of the Smithian gospel, including
the doctrine of polygamy, a sweet morsel
for the blood-thirsty Utes. They were
trying by every means, Machiavellian or
otherwise, to gain the Lamanites, as Indians
were called by the Mormons, at least to an
extent which would allow them to remain
undisturbed throughout the territory of
Utah. Old Kanosh and other leaders were
immersed for the remission of their sins,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
but they were permitted to multiply unto
themselves as many squaws as they cared
for. It would take water stronger than the
common alkaline pools contained to reach
the morals of a heathen Ute.</p>
<p>Very many of the Indians thus were made
Mormons and white men were appointed as
their bishops. Brigham Young used to
make visits to them to try to instruct them
in various things. For a considerable
period he was the Superintendent of Indian
Affairs for the Territory. He was
such official at the time of the lamentable
Mountain Meadow Massacre, in 1857, and
for which crime Bishop John D. Lee suffered
death.</p>
<p>Possibly it was the influence of Mr.
Young that kept the most of the red men
from the warpath and thus saved the scattered
settlers in the earlier days when there
were so few to guard the isolated homes in
the far-away nooks and ca&ntilde;ons of the
mountains.</p>
<p>The other sort of preaching in which the
elders indulged was that of an absolute and
unqualified denial of polygamy in Utah.
Such was the plan of the elders who went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
to Europe. The public denial of John
Taylor, later president of the church, is
abundant evidence. When they deny polygamy
now they have the consistency of
definition to back them; to their manner of
explaining, polygamy is the act of taking
new wives; to the non-Mormon, polygamy
is the possessing of more than one wife.
For this reason we are very bold in saying
that polygamy is publicly practiced in Utah&ndash;&ndash;witness
Joseph F. Smith as chief example.</p>
<p>Although we may read of it, none can
comprehend just what it means to a girl-wife,
two thousand miles away from her
parents, to be treated as an alien, in a land
under the flag of the free. This was the
case in the strictly Mormon settlements in
Utah thirty years ago. Reason only kept
the Giant Despair from the threshold of
the mind. The bravery of these women
can be compared only to the English
women of the Sepoy Rebellion days of
1857 in India, or to those of our American
sisters who accompanied their valorous
husbands to their isolated posts on the
Indian frontiers, resolved to share equally
in the dangers, and to die lingeringly and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
cruelly if necessary. Retreat and surrender
never grew in the hearts of such
women. It was so in the times that were
called the &ldquo;dark days&rdquo; in Utah&ndash;&ndash;the time
when the government applied its functions
to the stamping out of polygamous practices,
1883 to 1893&ndash;&ndash;ten terrible years for
the Mormon as well as the non-Mormon.</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that, unannounced,
a brawny, stalwart Indian might walk in
at the door. More than once has it so occurred
in our home. One day the door
was suddenly opened and in walked a
grinning brave, armed with a long knife,
and followed by his squaw; extending his
empty hand toward the far-from-home
girl-wife, alone in the house, he said,
&ldquo;How-do!&rdquo; In telling us of it, she said:
&ldquo;I was scared to death, I thought, but I
would have shaken hands with him if I
had died in the attempt. I would not let
him know I feared him.&rdquo; But this was
not Weber Tom.</p>
<p>It was in those fearsome days when the
leading men of Utah&ndash;&ndash;farmers, bankers,
stockmen, church dignitaries, all sorts and
conditions of the Latter-Day Saints&ndash;&ndash;were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
being arrested and haled to the courts almost
daily, that one morning there rode up
to our door the battle-scarred old warrior,
Weber Tom, chief of the Skull Valley Utes,
or Goshutes.</p>
<p>If perfection is beauty, this Indian was
most beautiful, for he was the ugliest
creature imaginable, ugly even to perfection.
One eye had been gouged out, a
knife-scar extended from his ear down
across his mouth, and he was Herculean in
physical proportions. I am a large man,
but once when I gave him an overcoat he
tried vainly to button it over his vast
frontal protuberance, looking at me and
saying, &ldquo;Too short, too short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This giant chief dismounted, and, seeing
my wife standing near, reached the reins of
the bridle to her and said, &ldquo;Here, squaw,
hol&rsquo; my hoss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said, quietly, &ldquo;Hold your own horse
if you want him held.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having had to accommodate himself to
the rudeness of a civilized woman, he made
other provision for his cayuse and then
asked her, &ldquo;Wheh yo&rsquo;man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him I was down in the field, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
he then proceeded to find me. He was in
the depths of trouble. He had several
squaw-wives and feared he was to be arrested
for it.</p>
<p>Now he approached me. It was dramatic;
it was high-class pantomime. It is
too bad the kinetoscope, cinematograph, or
some other moving-picture machine had not
been invented. He seemed awed by a
presence, yet so emboldened by the needs
of his case that he walked stoically to his
quest.</p>
<p>Squaring his Atlaslike shoulders, he began:
&ldquo;You heap big chief. You talky this
way&rdquo; (at the same time extending one
finger straight from his lips). &ldquo;Mormon he
talky this way&rdquo; (now extending two fingers,
to show he understood them to talk with
double tongue). &ldquo;Mormon telly me sojer
men ketchy me, put me in jug [jail]; me
havy two, tree, four squaw. You heap big
chief. You telly me this way&rdquo; (one finger).
Continuing, he said: &ldquo;Me havy two, tree,
four squaw. Mormon he telly me, me go
jug; one my squaw he know dat, he heap
cry, <i>heap</i> cry, HEAP cry, by um by die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was accompanied by gestures, throwing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
his body backward in imitation of the
dying woman whom fear had killed, according
to his dramatic story.</p>
<p>I told him something like this: &ldquo;No,
heap big lie. You go back Skull Valley,
you stay home, no sojer ketchy you, you
be heap good Injun!&rdquo; Upon this he grunted
deeply, shook hands cordially, went back to
his many-wived tents over across the creek,
and soon we saw them filing off through the
sagebrush toward their Skull Valley home,
many miles over the Onaqui range.</p>

<p>Polygamy <i>may</i> die in Mormondom, but
has never yet done so. Cases are often
reported, and from the manner of their
finding it is a certainty that new alliances
are being formed continually between married
men and unmarried women.</p>
<p>Not long ago a very bright conversion
was made in one of the missions of an
evangelical denomination. The convert was
a young woman of more than average intelligence.
Some of her relatives had been
polygamists, but she repudiated the whole
cult and creed. For a while this decision
made it necessary for her to find other
residence than her rightful home.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>Some time after she permitted herself to
be persuaded that a young man of her
acquaintance loved her more than he did
the polygamous tenet of his church&ndash;&ndash;he was a
Mormon&ndash;&ndash;and that he never would attempt
to woo and win another woman while she
remained his wife. She consented, and was
happy in her home life. Not for a moment
did she suspect him of double-dealing. Her
honest heart was above entertaining such
suspicion had it entered. Serenely she saw
her children growing to useful womanhood.
Not a cloud of anxiety appeared on the calm
sea of life; all was fine sailing. One day she
was making some repairs in one of her husband&rsquo;s
garments when a letter fell from a
pocket. It bore the postmark of a city
where they both had relatives, and it was
quite natural that she should look into its
contents.</p>
<p>What despair and agony seized her when
she read therein the statement from the
&ldquo;other woman&rdquo; telling her &ldquo;fond&rdquo; husband
of the birth of the child!</p>
<p>The poor, heart-stricken, and hitherto
trusting wife immediately rose to the dignity
of outraged womanhood and insulted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
wifehood and compelled the polygamist to
choose at once between her and the concubine.
He did so, choosing the younger
woman and leaving her who had trusted
him too fondly.</p>
<p>This is not a tale of the ancients in Utah,
but a living, festering story of the vivid
present.</p>
<p>One way of avoiding prosecution by the
law is the surreptitious, clandestine rearing
of children, whose mothers lose no prestige
in the community; for it is well understood
&ldquo;among the neighbors and friends.&rdquo; &ldquo;Public
polygamy has been suspended,&rdquo; but the
requirement of the doctrine remains unchanged.</p>

<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:2em;font-size:1.4em;'>GREAT SALT LAKE</p>
<p>Many stories, weird and lurid, true and
untrue, have been told of this body of
saline water lying imposed on the breast of
the beautiful and scenic State of Utah.
Although one of the transcontinental highways
of ocean-to-ocean travel has extended
its bands of steel directly across its wide
bosom for many miles, it is still a spot
where mystery lingers.</p>
<p>Private as well as public legends are
handed down from lip to ear rather than
from page to eye. For that reason there are
tales of this wonderful salt sea to be learned
only by residing in the vicinity. Its natural
moods are unlike the ocean, and its individual
characteristics would make a book.</p>
<p>The briny pond is but a wee thing as
compared with its gigantic dimensions in
the days when its waters were sweet and
had an outlet to the north. Then its arms
spread far south into Arizona, over into
Nevada and into Idaho. It was 350 miles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
from the northern end to the southern, and
145 miles across from east to west. The
area was 20,000 square miles. This greater
lake stood 1,000 feet higher than does the
present one, although this one is 4,280 feet
above the level of the sea. Geologists have
named the earlier one Bonneville, in honor
of the intrepid soldier-explorer whom Washington
Irving has so well fixed in American
literature.</p>
<p>By some as yet unknown cataclysm a
great break was made at the north end of
this inland ocean and its pent volume was
poured into the ca&ntilde;on of the Port Neuf
toward the ravenous Snake. This reduced
the level four hundred feet, but the old
beach line may still be easily noted. Gradually
this diminished body became smaller
and smaller until it reached the present
stage of desiccation.</p>
<p>So impure is this heavy liquid that after
evaporation there is a residuum of twenty-eight
pounds of solid matter in every hundred.
This is composed of salt, magnesium,
and other elements carrying three dollars of
gold to the ton; the gold is not made a
matter of trade or of industry because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
facilities are lacking for its handling. Very
little animal life is found in this brine, and
none of vegetable; in fact, at every point
where the water touches the shore vegetation
vanishes utterly. The animal life is
that of a very small gnat which, mosquito-like,
lays its eggs on the surface of the
water. The larv&aelig;, when driven shoreward,
collect in such quantities as to cause a
strong, unpleasant odor observable for miles
to the leeward. Myriads of seagulls here
find a dainty feast.</p>
<p>Salt Lake affords the finest and really the
only beach-bathing resort in the whole
interocean country. The bathing is attended
with little, if any, danger. In
thirty years only two persons have been
lost. These strangled before assistance
reached them. One body was found after
four years, lying in the salty sand at the
south end of the lake, whither the high
winds from the north had drifted it. All
the parts protected by the sand were perfectly
preserved and as beautiful as if
carved from Parian marble.</p>
<p>The tops of a number of sunken mountains
still protrude above the surface and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
form islands: such are Fremont, Church,
Stanbury, Carrington, and others. Some of
these are habitable, possessing fine springs
and irrigable land. Very few people live
on these islands, but some brave spirits
dare to face the semiprivations of such
isolation and stay there with their herds.</p>
<p>Doubtless, many tales of heroism and
devotion could be told of those who have
lived on these islands. One of the best
known is that of Mrs. Wenner, who, a few
years after her marriage, went with her
husband and little children to live on
Fremont Island. Her husband&rsquo;s health failing,
the oversight of the herds fell largely
upon her, but she cheerily took up the
burden, the while she trained her little
ones, and was ever a true companion to
him whom she daily saw slipping away.</p>
<p>The end came on a dread and fearsome
day, while the faithful man who worked
for them was detained on the mainland by
a raging storm. The children and an incompetent
woman could give her little assistance
or consolation. There on the
lonely, storm-lashed island, with faint-whispered
words of love, the dear one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
closed his eyes forever. Tenderly she cared
for his body, and sadly she kept her vigil,
replenishing through the long night the two
watchfires intended as a signal to those on
the mainland. On the night of the second
day, the man made his dangerous way back
to the island&ndash;&ndash;and with his help she laid
the loved husband in his island grave, with

<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;I panned him out over and over ag&rsquo;in,<br />
But found nary sign of color,&rdquo;<br />
Said Argonaut Sam one evening, when,<br />
As sitting atop of a box, to some men<br />
He was spinning a yarn of the gold-trail.<br />
<br />
<span class='indent38'>&nbsp;</span>And then,<br />
With arms set akimbo, he straightened his back<br />
And said: &ldquo;&rsquo;Twuz one night in the fifties I know;<br />
Ther&rsquo; kem up the trail frum the gulch jist below<br />
A youngish-like feller; but steppin&rsquo; so slow<br />
I heartily pitied him even before<br />
I saw his pale brow and heerd the sharp hack<br />
Of his troublesome cough, and plain enough lack<br />
Of more&rsquo;n enough power to bring to my door<br />
That tremblin&rsquo; young body.<br />
<br />

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span><br />
<span class='indent25'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;He hed a small pack&ndash;&ndash;<br />
A blanket an&rsquo; buckskin&ndash;&ndash;but that wa&rsquo;nt no lack<br />
In them days when notions an&rsquo; fashions wuz slack;<br />
When all a man needed, besides pick an&rsquo; pan,<br />
Wuz a wallet o&rsquo; leather to tie up his dust&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;R<br />
a place to git grub-staked (that means to git trust<br />
Till he found a good prospeck); an&rsquo; then he&rsquo;d put in<br />
His very best licks; fur in them days &rsquo;twuz sin<br />
Fer a man strong o&rsquo; body, o&rsquo; wind an&rsquo; o&rsquo; limb<br />
T&rsquo; hang erround loafin&rsquo; all day, &rsquo;twuz too thin.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Well, this puny feller hed grin&rsquo;-stunlike grit,<br />
But wuz clean tuckered out when my cabin he hit;<br />
&rsquo;N fell down a-faintin&rsquo; jist inside my door&ndash;&ndash;<br />
His eyes set &rsquo;n&rsquo; glassy&ndash;&ndash;he seemed done fer, shore.<br />
So I straightened him out, couldn&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span><br />
<br />
Than to put back his hair an&rsquo; t&rsquo; dampen his brow,<br />
An&rsquo; to feel fer his pulse&ndash;&ndash;joy! I found  it&ndash;&ndash;slow<br />
An&rsquo; flickery though, stoppin&rsquo; and startin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; now<br />
Gone ag&rsquo;in; then it revived, but so faint, don&rsquo;t you know,<br />
That minute by minute I couldn&rsquo;t hev said<br />
Whether the feller wuz livin&rsquo; or dead.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;All night I watched by him; an&rsquo; &rsquo;long a-to&rsquo;rds light<br />
I seed that a change hed come: so, honor bright!<br />
I made up my mind that I&rsquo;d save that young life<br />
If it took me all summer. I&rsquo;d fight<br />
With grim death to a finish fer him.<br />
<br />
<span class='indent34'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;An&rsquo; so I begun.<br />
I quit workin&rsquo; my claim<br />
Where I&rsquo;d git on an average (&rsquo;pon my good name)<br />
An ounce or more daily of number one gold.<br />
An&rsquo; in them days we thought nothin&rsquo;, you see,<br />
Of layin&rsquo; by stuff fer a rainy day; we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span><br />
Hed plenty; the diggins wuz rich, an&rsquo; wuz thick<br />
Scattered over the kentry. Most every crick<br />
Hed plenty o&rsquo; gold in nuggets or dust&ndash;&ndash;<br />
An&rsquo; the man who wuz stingy hed ort to be cussed.<br />
So I shouldered my task.<br />
<br />
<span class='indent28'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;It wuz wonderful how<br />
The new life appeared to come back to my boy;<br />
(Fer that&rsquo;s what I called him&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;my boy&rsquo;) an&rsquo; the joy<br />
O&rsquo; perviden fer suthin&rsquo; besides my lone self<br />
Made me happy. Y&rsquo; see, th&rsquo; experunce wuz new;<br />
Fer I&rsquo;d lived all alone ever since forty-two,<br />
When, back in Ohio, I&rsquo;d buried my wife<br />
An&rsquo; baby. Since then I&rsquo;d looked on my life<br />
As a weary, onfriendly, detestable load.<br />
So that&rsquo;s why I lived all alone, don&rsquo;t you see?<br />
I didn&rsquo;t love nothin&rsquo; and nothin&rsquo; loved me.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;But now of young Josh&ndash;&ndash;his name wuz Josh Clark&ndash;&ndash;<br />
He&rsquo;d come frum ol&rsquo; York State&ndash;&ndash;could sing like a lark&ndash;&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span><br />
Wuz finely brung up, an&rsquo; that mother o&rsquo; his,<br />
A sister he tol&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; a girl he called Liz.<br />
&rsquo;D a give the hull earth if they only could know<br />
If he wuz alive; but so hard-hearted, he<br />
Would never be grateful to them nur to me.<br />
Though I had no claim on him, yet it would seem<br />
After all I hed done fer him, shorely some gleam<br />
O&rsquo; thankfulness somewhere might some time be seen.<br />
&rsquo;Sides spendin&rsquo; my all I hed broken down too,<br />
Wuz a shattered ol&rsquo; man, though but then fifty-two;<br />
Fer I&rsquo;d give up my health an&rsquo; my strength to pull through<br />
My boy&ndash;&ndash;fer I loved him, if ever men do.<br />
But, no; it appeared that he hedn&rsquo;t no heart.<br />
Not once did he thank me, and never asked why<br />
I nussed him to life, &rsquo;stid o&rsquo; lettin&rsquo; him die.<br />

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span><br />
<br />
&ldquo;His wants wuz demands, his wishes commands,<br />
An&rsquo; once in the dusk, as we set on the sands<br />
Of a stream that run by, he reached with his hands<br />
So quick an&rsquo; so blamed unexpected, you see,<br />
Grabbed me by the hair an&rsquo; out with a knife,<br />
An&rsquo; demanded my gold. I thought fer my life<br />
He wuz jokin&rsquo;; but no, when I seed that fierce look<br />
Of murder an&rsquo; pillage, I knowed what I&rsquo;d done;<br />
I&rsquo;d thawed out a viper upon my hearth-stun<br />
An&rsquo; now wuz becomin&rsquo; its prey.<br />
<br />
<span class='indent29'>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;But, I&rsquo;d none:<br />
I&rsquo;d spent all the surplus I hed to save him.<br />
I&rsquo;d missed all the summer an&rsquo; fall to nuss him<br />
Who now like a tiger wuz takin&rsquo; my life.<br />
&lsquo;Hol&rsquo; on, my dear Josh! Hol&rsquo; on, my dear boy!&rsquo;<br />
No further I got, fer his hands clutched my throat&ndash;&ndash;<br />
I squirmed myself loose, but grapplin&rsquo; my coat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span><br />
He throwed me ag&rsquo;in, now a madman, indeed.<br />
His dirk-knife wuz raised. I said, &lsquo;Do yer best.<br />
I&rsquo;ve give you now all that I ever possessed<br />
But life. Take it now if you like!&rsquo; An&rsquo; he struck.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;How long I laid there in the dark, I don&rsquo;t know;<br />
But when I kem to I wuz layin&rsquo; in bed,<br />
An&rsquo; the people wuz talkin&rsquo; so easy an&rsquo; low,<br />
An&rsquo; I knowed by the bandages too on my head<br />
That I hed been nigh to the gates o&rsquo; the dead.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;An&rsquo; &lsquo;Where wuz Josh Clark?&rsquo; did you say? I don&rsquo;t know.<br />
He never wuz seen in the diggins below,<br />
Ner heerd of in them parts ag&rsquo;in, fer I know<br />
He&rsquo;d a-swung to the limb that come fust in the way;<br />
Fer the boys in them days hed little to say,<br />
But wuz mighty in doin&rsquo;. So he got away.

&ldquo;So it seems that some people is jist so depraved<br />
There ain&rsquo;t a thing in &rsquo;em that ort to be saved.<br />
&rsquo;Twuz jist so with Josh, who I loved as a son;<br />
He lived fer hisself an&rsquo; fer hisself alone.<br />
&rsquo;N&rsquo; &rsquo;at&rsquo;s why I remarked at the fust of this yarn,<br />
The thing &rsquo;at it&rsquo;s cost me so dearly to larn&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;I panned him out over an&rsquo; over ag&rsquo;in,<br />

<p>We dread the unseen. Fear is always
enervating; sometimes even deadly. Who
has not fearsomely anticipated that which
never came and wasted valuable energy
and time in building bridges none are ever
to cross? The surgical patient actually suffers
more at sight of somber white-clad
nurses, and the thought of the operation,
than he does from the ordeal itself. It
may be that we subconsciously dread the
helpless state of unconsciousness into which
the an&aelig;sthetic plunges us, and hesitate at
a trip, no matter how short, into death&rsquo;s
borderland, preferring to keep our own
hands as long as possible on the helm of
the ship of life.</p>
<p>I wonder why we become terror-stricken
at the thought of ghosts. The untutored
child needs only a hint to make him shy at
the dark; and a lad has to be pretty large
before he can walk far at night without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
once in a while looking behind him, just to
be certain there is nothing following.</p>
<p>Thus spirits, spooks, bogies, wraiths, and
other uncanny apparitions are unintentional
inheritances of the race; a race that knows
little more about the impending and impinging
unseen than did the Saxon fathers
who gave us our spooky speech.</p>
<p>I once had an experience which grows in
interest as the years pass by. I had no
fear or thought of fear that night, and the
scenes of the evening were absolutely unannounced;
they entered upon the sleety
stage for whose violent acts I held no
program.</p>
<p>One afternoon I was to go to one of my
appointments, a mining town in Utah. In
order to relieve home cares I took with me
my four-year-old son, who thus would get
some novel entertainment as well. To the
buggy I hitched Jenny, the strawberry-roan
cayuse, and started for the distant point.
It was a little stormy all the way, and by
the time we had well begun the service it
had thickened so that a hard snow was
setting in. It was dead in the north and
continued with such strength that soon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
there appeared no slant to the falling
columns. By the time church was dismissed
the blizzard was on in full force,
and the roads were already so filled with
the new drifts that to return with the
buggy was hardly thinkable. I borrowed a
saddle, and leaving the little lad with
friends, started for home, where I was
under appointment to preach that evening.
My way lay in the north, in the very teeth
of the raging storm. With head tucked
down, I trusted the reins to Jenny, who
had never disappointed me in many a
mountain trip, but I had not gone far until
I found the storm was at my back. Peering
sharply through the fast falling darkness, I
discovered that the mountains were on my
left instead of on my right, as they should
have been. Jenny had turned tail to the
storm. Feeling herself unwilling to face the
arctic onset, she was retreating.</p>
<p>Only the dire necessity of the occasion
made me compel her to face the torturing
attack of the icy shafts that were hurling
themselves on us like steel points.</p>
<p>We were forced, Jenny and I, to abandon
the only road, now drift-filled, and take an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
unbroken way through the sagebrush, junipers,
buckbrush, and other tangled chaparral,
where there was no trail at all, and
farther to the right, that I might keep an
eye on the mountains and not get turned
around again. I felt the force of Cardinal
Newman&rsquo;s immortal hymn,</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>... amid the encircling gloom,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Lead thou me on!<br />
The night is dark and I am far from home;<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Lead thou me on!</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>We had not gone far until I began to
hear the sweetest music. I could not
imagine from whence it fell, as I knew
there was not a human home in all that
plain between the two settlements. Then I
heard personal conversation; in fact, the
night was full of pleasant travelers. The
awful storm seemed not to affect them in
the least. They seemed to have an open
road too, while we were plunging through
deep snowdrifts, my feet already dragging
along their tops.</p>
<p>When the first carriage load came up I
saw it was only a desert juniper. The
boreal gale sweeping through its shivering
branches made converse in the music of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
the wild, Jenny and I being the only seat-holders
in that grand opera. Soon another
caravan of belated folks drove up; but it
was only a load of hay that had been over-tipped.
Others came, but they were only
bushes or some inanimate object. There
was little life out on that perishing night.</p>
<p>After hours of fearsome and benumbing
travel, Jenny stumbled with me into the
little home town. A good feed of oats and
a warm shelter doubtless ended the story
happily for her. But for me&ndash;&ndash;the ghost of
the desert and the wraith of the blizzard
had become real. They spoke to me that
night and I understood.</p>

<p>Possibly there are those who find themselves
thinking that Western tales are travelers&rsquo;
tales and must be taken with &ldquo;a grain
of salt.&rdquo; Some also say that the man who
crosses the Missouri never is able to tell
the truth again; this is crude, I know, and
in some cases true, but they who are so
afflicted were just the same before they ever
saw the Missouri.</p>
<p>Our waterless areas were considered by
Captain Bonneville (as told by Washington
Irving) utterly barren and forever hopeless
wastes. In Astoria&ndash;&ndash;chapter thirty-four&ndash;&ndash;these
words are used:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this dreary desert of sand and gravel
of the Snake here and there is a thin and
scanty herbage, insufficient for the horse or
the buffalo. Indeed, these treeless wastes
between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific
are even more desolate and barren than
the naked, upper prairies on the Atlantic
side; they present vast desert tracts that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
must ever defy cultivation, and interpose
dreary and thirsty wilds between the habitations
of man, in traversing which the
wanderer will often be in danger of perishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So thought Captain Bonneville; so wrote
the matchless American <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>, Washington
Irving, of &ldquo;Sunnyside,&rdquo; author and
authority, creator of The Life of George
Washington, and the Broken Heart, which
made Lord Byron weep. The doughty
Captain Benjamin L. E. Bonneville, who
died as late as 1878, obtaining leave of
absence and a furlough, endured the
pleasure of hardships common to the explorer,
and through his happy biographer
added the Trail to literature; but his
eye of vision did not see these great
stones of the commonwealth, Utah, Wyoming,
Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.
The very region so carefully pictured above
as the dreariest of deserts, a veritable
Western Sahara, is the exact location of
Idaho and a large portion of Oregon; a
region perfectly adapted to the sustenance
of immense population and intense development.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>Moses understood all the wisdom of the
Egyptians. We do not, but we do know
that the biggest thing in an arid country
is the ditch. America&rsquo;s triumph to date
in the twentieth century is the completion
of the Panama Ditch. The ditch is in
Idaho more valuable by far than the land,
for without it the parched soil is practically
worthless, being an area of shimmering sand,
where the ash-colored and dust-covered
sagebrush breeds the loathsome horned
toad, the rough-and-ready rattlesnake, and
the slinking, night-hunting coyote, which
preys on the lithe-limbed, loping jack rabbit.</p>
<p>The modern Western American is rapidly
learning a modified wisdom of the ancient
irrigators of Egypt, and already knows how
to drain the irrigated acres and leech
these old alluvial plains. From the days
when the frosty glacial plowman ran his
deep basaltic furrows for the majestic Snake
and other streams, these gorges of nature
had been only mossy beds over which lazily
slid the unmeasured volumes down to the
western and &ldquo;bitter moon-mad sea.&rdquo; Now
man, the mightiest of all magicians, has
lured the liquid serpents from their age-long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
couches, cut them into thousands of
smaller streams, and sent them bravely
abroad on the face of the protesting desert,
drowning its death and making it to bloom
and blossom.</p>
<p>As a concrete instance of the artificial
possibilities of Idaho and contiguous regions,
I will here instance a statement made
for me by the Rev. H. W. Parker, superintendent
of Pocatello District, and resident
of Twin Falls, under date of October, 1914:
&ldquo;Where ten years ago this very minute
there was not a fence nor a furrow (only
the conditions above described by Washington
Irving) there are now such municipalities
as Twin Falls, Filer, Rupert, Burley,
and others soon to be as fine. As
pastor in 1904, my first official trip to Twin
Falls was made on July 14. I found one or
two frame buildings and some tents stuck
around in the sagebrush; some streets had
been marked out, but no grading had been
done. Dust, heat, and sagebrush were the
main features of the place. In October I
preached the first sermon ever delivered by
any minister in the new village. The congregation
numbered forty-one. On February
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
5, 1905, I organized the first church
with seventeen members; on May 23, 1909,
we dedicated the present edifice at a cost
of $18,000, exclusive of the lots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day this church has a membership of
more than five hundred. This youngster
has turned back into the treasuries of the
denomination in regular collections more
than $3,000. The city has to-day seven
thousand people. There are between four
and five miles of asphalt-paved streets, a
perfect sewer system, and cement sidewalks
throughout the whole municipality. An investment
of $120,000 has been made in two
splendidly equipped grade school buildings,
besides a high school costing a quarter of a
million dollars. These combined schools
have an enrollment of over two thousand
pupils with a teaching force of above sixty;
the high school graduated forty-eight last
commencement. There is not a saloon in
the entire county.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely &ldquo;progress&rdquo; is here spelled in large
letters.</p>
<p>Years ago, with the narrow strip along
the Atlantic in mind, Longfellow wrote,
&ldquo;God had sifted three kingdoms to find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
the wheat for this planting.&rdquo; And as the
mighty empire took its course toward the
West of limitless opportunity the good God
kept the sieve running full time, so that
